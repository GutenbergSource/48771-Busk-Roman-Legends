<p class="first">I had heard it so often positively asserted that
modern Italy had no popular mythology, and no contribution of special
versions to offer to the world&rsquo;s store of Traditionary Tales,
that, while possessing every opportunity, I was many years without
venturing to set myself against the prevailing opinion so far as to
attempt putting it to the proof.</p>
<p>A certain humble friend, however, used time after time so to impress
me with the fancy that she had all the qualifications for being a
valuable repository of such lore if it only existed, that I was finally
led to examine her on the subject. She gave me a capital opportunity
one day when, during a visit to a bedridden cripple whom she nursed,
she was flapping the dust off the pictures and ornaments with a
feather-brush according to the Roman idea of dusting. &lsquo;I never do
any dusting,&rsquo; she said the while, &lsquo;but I always think of
<i lang="it">Monsignor Delegato</i> dusting the altar of the holy house
of Loreto. And now I think of it, he was not called Monsignor Delegato,
but Monsignor Commissario. But every evening of my life while I was
young and living at Loreto, I have seen him dust the altar of the
<i lang="it">Santa Casa</i> at 23 o&rsquo;clock,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e180src" href="#xd26e180" name="xd26e180src">1</a> before they
shut <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e183" href="#xd26e183" name=
"xd26e183">vi</a>]</span>up the church, saying a <i lang="it">Salve
Regina</i> for the benefactors of the spot.&rsquo; If she was so
<span class="corr" id="xd26e189" title=
"Source: familar">familiar</span> with Loreto, I concluded, and had so
noticed and remembered its customs, probably she was not ignorant of
its Legends either, and I commenced my inquisition at once.</p>
<p>I have not given her Legends of Loreto in the text because, being
tolerably familiar, they were among those which could best be
sacrificed to the exigencies of space. I gathered on that day, however,
one version of S. Giovanni Bocca d&rsquo;oro, with two stories of Padre
Filippo: and her subsequent testimony concerning the crucifix of
Scirollo came in usefully (pp. 193, 195) in illustration of the Legend
of Pietro Bailliardo; but, what was precious to me above all, I gained
the proof and earnest that there was certainly a vein of legendary lore
underlying the classic soil of Rome, and that it only remained to find
the means of working it.</p>
<p>I first lazily set myself to hunt through the bookshops, new and
old, to find any sort of collection of traditionary tales ready made;
but only with the effect of establishing the fact that no Italian Grimm
had yet arisen to collect and organise them, and put them into
available shape.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e196src" href="#xd26e196"
name="xd26e196src">2</a></p>
<p>It is true the erudite and indefatigable Cesare Cant&ugrave; has
found time in the midst of his more important labours <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e201" href="#xd26e201" name=
"xd26e201">vii</a>]</span>to illustrate some few remnants of
medi&aelig;val customs and sayings yet lingering in the north of Italy,
in his &lsquo;Novelle Lombarde;&rsquo; and he tells me that the Balio
Benvenuti, also of Milan, is bringing out another little volume about
Lombard customs; but even these have not approached the fairy tales,
and leave Central and Southern Italy altogether untouched.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e203src" href="#xd26e203" name=
"xd26e203src">3</a></p>
<p>The nearest approach to the material of which I was in search was
afforded in the roughly printed rimed legends which itinerant venders
sell at the church doors on festa days. Among the collection I have
made of these, are many whose quaintness gives them special interest,
notwithstanding their baldness of style and diction; but the matter
which came to me first hand seemed to have the first claim to
publication; and I have, therefore, put these among my reserve for a
second series.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e211src" href="#xd26e211"
name="xd26e211src">4</a></p>
<p>No repository of Roman Folklore was to be found ready-formed.
&lsquo;Who among us,&rsquo; writes Cesare Cant&ugrave; in his preface
to his &lsquo;Novelle Lombarde,&rsquo; &lsquo;knows anything about
these matters? If they were the things of Scotland or Touraine we
should all have read them long ago in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e216" href="#xd26e216" name="xd26e216">viii</a>]</span>pages of
Scott or Balzac. But here among us there are neither writers who care
to describe nor readers who take any interest in learning the ways of
our own country. People like to seem above giving their attention to
such homely matters, and only care for what they must look at through a
telescope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was thus thrown back on my own powers of collecting, and found the
process, however fascinating where successful, much more uphill work
than it had promised to be at the outset. Legends, it is true, there
was less difficulty in obtaining. There might be some sense and some
moral in them, and I found people were not ashamed of knowing them; but
it long remained impossible to convince persons who had even betrayed
to me indications that they possessed what I wanted, to own fully to a
knowledge of <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> Fairy Tales, or to believe that I
could be serious in wishing to listen to such childish nonsense.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But suppose you had a child to amuse,&rsquo; I would say at
last, &lsquo;I am sure you would sometimes tell it a marvellous
story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, a <i>creatura</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e230src"
href="#xd26e230" name="xd26e230src">5</a> yes! But I haven&rsquo;t the
face to tell such nonsense to your <i>signoria</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind that, if I want to hear it. Imagine I am the
<i>creatura</i>, and tell me one of your tales. I want something about
transformations, fairy gifts, and marvels of all sorts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In some such way, after due precaution taken to convince me that
such things were only allowed a place in the memory for the sake of
amusing children, and not because anyone believed in them, one tale
after another would be suffered reluctantly to ooze out. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e244" href="#xd26e244" name=
"xd26e244">ix</a>]</span></p>
<p>But you cannot make application for such wares to the first person
you meet. The class in which such lore is stored away is not indeed so
exclusive that introductions to it are a very difficult matter, but
introduction of some sort you must have; some claim for taking up a
person&rsquo;s time, where time is money; and some means of
compensation you must devise, the more difficult to invent where direct
payment would be an offence. Your modern Romans are very independent; I
cannot say whether the quality is more an inheritance from their
ancient forefathers, or adopted from the continental spread of French
revolutionary ideas of &rsquo;93. True, they are singularly urbane and
deferential, but only so long as you are urbane and deferential towards
them. If you omit any of their peculiar forms of politeness, they are
suspicious of you, and scarcely know how to make allowance for the
well-meaning inexperience of a foreigner. If you want to learn anything
from them you must submit to become one of them. You must converse
first on the subject uppermost in their minds, from the price of bread
and meat to the latest change in the political atmosphere; only when
all is exhausted may you venture to come round to the matter of which
you are in search. Many, too, in whose memories such stories have lain
dormant since childhood, for more than half a century, have not the
power of recalling them in due form or order for narration on abrupt
application, but will yet bring them out unconsciously if patiently led
up to an appropriate starting point.</p>
<p>Nor is it every application, made with all precautions, that will be
successful. Often you must submit to be put off with the tantalising
experience that a person knew <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e249"
href="#xd26e249" name="xd26e249">x</a>]</span>plenty of stories, but
was quite incapable of putting them into shape. This happened once with
an intelligent old lady from Siena, whom, after allowing her to indulge
her irony at my expense concerning my childishness in seeking such
things, I brought to confess that she had heard in her youth a strange
story of a cat which wore <i lang="it">stivali di cacciatore</i>
(hunter&rsquo;s boots), but she could not succeed in recalling a single
incident of it; and I was obliged to content myself with the
information (no small encouragement in the early days of my work,
however!) that &lsquo;Puss in Boots&rsquo; had actually travelled to
Tuscany.</p>
<p>At another time one would have to spend hours in listening to
detached incidents altogether lacking a thread to connect them, or
stories of which the point had been so completely lost that they could
only have been made available by means of a reconstruction too integral
to be honestly attempted. As, e.g., &lsquo;Oh yes! I know a story of an
enchantress who had a gown which made her invisible, and a pair of
boots which would carry her a thousand miles without walking, but I
quite forget what she did with them.&rsquo; Or else it might be,
&lsquo;I knew a story of a king whose wife had been <i>fatata</i>
(subjected to magic influence), and maligned by her mother-in-law while
the king was gone to the wars; but that&rsquo;s all I remember, except
that in the end the queen was rehabilitated, and the mother-in-law
punished&rsquo;&mdash;incidents of stories recurring in every
collection, but tantalisingly lacking all means of further particular
identification with any. Sometimes, too, it would be only a title that
could be recalled, and nothing more, as in the case of a certain
&lsquo;Uccello Biverde,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e259src" href=
"#xd26e259" name="xd26e259src">6</a> which I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e270" href="#xd26e270" name=
"xd26e270">xi</a>]</span>have been several times assured is &lsquo;a
most beautiful story,&rsquo; but I have never yet succeeded in meeting
with any one who could supply the narrative. I have further felt called
sometimes to exercise a difficult forbearance in withholding some
specimens which at first promised to afford singular instances of
interchanged episodes, but which there afterwards appeared reason to
conclude were merely jumbled in the bad memory of the narrator, and
had, therefore, no individual interest, but were rather calculated to
mislead.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e272src" href="#xd26e272" name=
"xd26e272src">7</a></p>
<p>One of my worst disappointments was the case of a very old woman,
who, I am assured, knows more of such things than anyone in the world,
but whom nothing can induce to repeat them now. She has grown so
toothless and tremulous and inconsecutive, that it is not easy to
understand her; but I think her arguments are not difficult to
appreciate in the following way,&mdash;that having had a long run of
weary bad fortune, she had rather not dwell on stories where things
turned out as one could wish to have them. She wants to go to heaven,
she says, and so she believes in God, and whatever else she <i>must</i>
believe; but for anything more, for special interpositions of
Providence, and anything one is not obliged to believe, she had rather
say nothing about all that. &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t tell them then as if
you believed them; tell them only as a pastime; just to oblige
me.&rsquo; I thought I had moved her, but the utmost she would yield
was to promise to think about it before I came again: and when I came
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e280" href="#xd26e280" name=
"xd26e280">xii</a>]</span>again she was as rigid as ever. It is
vexatious to think that a vast store is going to the grave with her
under one&rsquo;s very eyes and that one cannot touch it.</p>
<p>It is further to be remarked, that while there are thus a vast
number of persons holding the store of traditional myths, it by no
means includes the generality of the population; there is a still
larger class among whom every trace of such lore is lost. So destitute
are they of all knowledge of the kind, that it would be interesting to
trace back the antecedents of each, and so discover, if it might be,
the origin of this discrepancy; for not only have I found it impossible
myself to stir up any memory of such stories in half the people I have
applied to, (though, to all appearance, similarly circumstanced with
those who have proved the most communicative), but old
&lsquo;gossips,&rsquo; sitting by while the stories in the text were
being poured out, have, time after time, displayed a wonderment which
proved that their very style was something quite new to them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in spite of all difficulties, a few years&rsquo;
patience has put me in possession of a goodly bulk of popular stories
not yielding in interest, I think, to those of any other country. The
tales included in the present collection are but a portion of those
which I have gathered within the limits of the Roman State. I hope to
be able to complete at some future day the remainder that I have
gathered both there and from other divisions of the former Heptarchy of
Italy. The localities from which these have been chiefly drawn are
Palombara, Capranica, Loreto, Sinigaglia, Viterbo, Cori, Palestrina,
and, above all, Rome itself. One of my chief contributors had passed
her whole existence&mdash;infancy, married life, and
widow-hood<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e286" href="#xd26e286"
name="xd26e286">xiii</a>]</span>&mdash;within the limits of one parish
in the heart of Rome.</p>
<p>The collection has arranged itself, according to the spontaneous
titling of the narrators, into four categories, and it may not be
unimportant to note that Romans, always precise in their choice of
language, keep rigidly to these designations. I have, for instance,
been on the very verge of passing over a whole mine of
&lsquo;Esempj,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Ciarpe&rsquo; by only asking for
&lsquo;Favole&rsquo; (and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>). Remembering
afterwards to say, &lsquo;I daresay you can, at all events, recall some
&ldquo;Esempj,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ciarpe,&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; I have
received for answer, &lsquo;To be sure; why didn&rsquo;t you say sooner
that such would suit you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The said four categories are,&mdash;</p>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Esempj</span>, or those stories under which some
religious or moral lessons might be conveyed, answering to what we call
Legends. Though the word <i>Leggenda</i> exists in the dictionary, and
is not altogether unused, I have never once met it among the
people.</p>
<p>2. Ghost stories and local and family traditions. The latter are
much more carefully preserved than among our own people,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e306src" href="#xd26e306" name="xd26e306src">8</a>
and the Roman poor will tell the tale (more or less accurately) of the
virtues and vices of their great families, with a gusto which shows
that they look upon them as something specially belonging to
themselves; but the former do not appear to have any recognised title,
and the contempt in which they are held makes it very difficult to get
hold of them, so that it is not very easy to avoid giving offence in
approaching the subject. Only by a prolonged and round-about
conversation one may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e309" href=
"#xd26e309" name="xd26e309">xiv</a>]</span>sometimes elicit excellent
specimens brought in as matters of curious personal experience by the
very persons who, on direct questioning, had repudiated all knowledge
of anything of the sort.</p>
<p>3. <span class="sc">Favole.</span> The word universally appropriated
in Roman dialect for &lsquo;Fairy Tales,&rsquo; a not unclassical
application of the term, I think, and continued in the
&lsquo;Fabliaux&rsquo; of the medi&aelig;val period. But when asking
for them I have never had any given me belonging to the class which we
call &lsquo;fables&rsquo; in English.</p>
<p>4. <span class="sc">Ciarpe</span>, expounded by Bazzarelli as
<i>parole vane</i>, <i>ciance</i>; <i>ciance</i> being said, on the
authority of Petrarch, to stand for <i>parole vane</i>, <i>lontane dal
vero</i>, <i>chiacchiera</i>; <i>chiacchiera</i> being the equivalent
for gossip. Versions of some stories in this category, notably No. 6,
&lsquo;L&rsquo;Uccelletto&rsquo; (The Little Bird), and 21, &lsquo;The
Value of Salt,&rsquo; we all heard in our English nurseries, while
those under the heading of &lsquo;La Sposa Cece&rsquo; (The Simple
Wife) belong to the same class as ours of the man who being told to
give his wife her medicine in a convenient vehicle, wheeled her about
in a hand-barrow, while she swallowed it; or that of the idiotic couple
who wasted their three precious chances in wishing three yards of black
pudding on each other&rsquo;s noses, and then wishing it off again; but
I do not know that we have any special technical designation for such.
All the headings of which I have given the Italian are those used by
the narrators themselves.</p>
<p>It is impossible, in making acquaintance with these stories in their
own language, not to regret having to put them into another tongue.
Much of what is peculiar in them, and distinguishes them from their
counterparts in other lands, is, of course, wrapped up in the form of
expression <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e345" href="#xd26e345"
name="xd26e345">xv</a>]</span>in which they are clothed. Divested of
this, they run the risk of losing the national character they have
acquired during their residence on Italian soil. I had purposed,
therefore, originally, to print an Italian version, side by side with
the English rendering, but was obliged to renounce the arrangement, as
it would have proved too voluminous. I have only been able to preserve
some few of the vernacular idiosyncrasies in the notes, for the benefit
of those who take an interest in the people&rsquo;s characteristic
utterances.</p>
<p>I think I may safely say that the whole of the stories are
traditional. There were only two of my contributors who could have read
them had they even existed in print. The best-instructed of them was
the one who gave me &lsquo;Prete Olivo&rsquo; and &lsquo;<span lang=
"it">Perch&egrave; litigano i cani ed i gatti</span>;&rsquo; both of
which I am clear, from &lsquo;asides&rsquo; which accompanied them
concerning her father&rsquo;s manner of telling, she had heard from his
lips, even as she said.</p>
<p>With the exception of some of the Legends, Local Traditions, and
Ciarpe, there are few, either printed in this collection or among those
I still hold in MS., the leading episodes of which (if not the entire
story) are not to be found in the collections of other countries; but
certain categories common in other countries are wanting in the Roman.
One could not in making the collection but be struck with the almost
complete absence of stories of heroism and chivalry. There are some,
indeed, in which courageous deeds occur; but there is none of the
high-souled mettle which comes out so strong in Hungarian, Gaelic, and
Spanish tradition, in many of the Teutonic and Breton, and some Norse
and Russian tales. Several, we shall find, are identical stories, with
the grand and fierce <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e354" href=
"#xd26e354" name="xd26e354">xvi</a>]</span>element left out. I have
never come across a single story of knightly prowess in any shape. I
have in MS. one or two dragon stories, but no knights figure even in
these. At the same time, tales of horror seem equally to have failed to
fascinate the popular imagination, and we can trace again the toning
down process in many instances. I have in MS. several versions of the
rather ghastly story of the boy who went out to discover Fear, but the
Roman mind does not often indulge in such scenes as it presents.
Similarly, horrid monsters are rare. &lsquo;Orco&rsquo; himself is not
painted so terrible as in other countries. Giants and dwarfs, again,
being somewhat monstrous creations, are not frequent. The stories about
the <i>Satiri</i> were only told me spontaneously by one narrator; one
other owned to having heard of such beings on being questioned, but
there is no general popular conception corresponding to the German
ideas of wild men. I have never met anyone who believed in the present
existence of any supernatural being of this class,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e359src" href="#xd26e359" name="xd26e359src">9</a> and rarely
with any who imagined such had ever existed. &lsquo;The stories always
say, &ldquo;there was a fairy who did so and so:&rdquo; but <i>were</i>
there ever fairies? Perhaps there were, perhaps there
weren&rsquo;t,&rsquo; soliloquised an old woman one day at the end of a
tale; that was the strongest expression of opinion in their favour that
came in my way. Another said once, &lsquo;If there ever were such
beings there would be now; but there certainly are not any now, so I
don&rsquo;t believe there ever were any.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e365src" href="#xd26e365" name="xd26e365src">10</a></p>
<p>Again, religious legends, with admixture of pagan superstitions,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e373" href="#xd26e373" name=
"xd26e373">xvii</a>]</span>seem rare. English readers may say that
there is superstition in some of the legends in the text; but they only
exaggerate the literalness with which they deal with Gospel promises;
there is little at variance with it. The false tale of the pilgrim
husband, pp. 355&ndash;6, is the most devious from Christian doctrine
that I have come across in Rome. I cannot fancy a Roman, however
illiterate, gravely telling such stories as some of those which Mr.
Ralstone gives us from Russia. The story of &lsquo;Pret&rsquo;
Olivo&rsquo; is doubtless derivatively the same as Dr. Dasent&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Master Smith&rsquo;; but the Roman version presents vastly less
of the pagan element.</p>
<p>In winding up his general remarks on the migrations of myths, Prof.
de Gubernatis gives as his opinion that &lsquo;the elementary myth was
the spontaneous production of imagination and not of reflection;&rsquo;
&hellip; that &lsquo;morals have often been made an appendix to fables,
but never entered into the primitive fable;&rsquo; that &lsquo;art and
religion have made use of the already existing myths (themselves devoid
of moral conscience) as allegories for their own &aelig;sthetic and
moral ends.&rsquo; And it appears to me that the Romans, in adapting
such elementary myths to legendary use, have christianised them more
than some other peoples.</p>
<p>Pacts with the Devil, in which the Germans revel, are rare; the
story of &lsquo;Pietro Bailliardo&rsquo; is one of the very few. It
would seem that witchcraft never at any time obtained any great hold
upon the people of Rome, nor were witches ever treated with the same
severity which befell them in other parts of Europe. It is true that
some stories about witch-stepmothers wind up with &lsquo;<span lang=
"it">e la brucciorno in mezzo alla Piazza</span>,&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e382src" href="#xd26e382" name="xd26e382src">11</a>
but I am inclined to think it is rather a &lsquo;tag&rsquo; received
from other countries, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e385" href=
"#xd26e385" name="xd26e385">xviii</a>]</span>than an actual local
tradition; and certainly by cross-questioning I failed to awaken in the
memory of the &lsquo;oldest inhabitants&rsquo; with whom I have had the
opportunity of conversing any tradition of anything of the sort having
actually taken place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do <i>you</i> know about burning witches <i lang="it">in
mezzo alla Piazza</i>? I thought such things were never done in
Rome?&rsquo; I observed one day to one who ended a story thus.
&lsquo;Who said the story took place in Rome?&rsquo; was the ready
reply. I received the same reply to the same observation from another,
with the addition of &lsquo;There was something about a king and a
queen in the story and in other stories I have told you, and we never
had a king or a queen of Rome&mdash;the one may belong to the same
country as the other. Who knows what sort of a country such stories
come from!&rsquo; A third answered, &lsquo;No; I don&rsquo;t believe
witches were ever burnt by law in Rome; I have always heard say that
our laws were less fierce than those of some other countries; but I can
quite fancy that if the people found a witch doing such things as I
have told you, they would burn her all by themselves, law or no
law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of course I have no pretension that my researches have been
exhaustive, nor have I been, properly speaking, searching for
superstitions, but in a good deal of intercourse with the uneducated, I
have certainly <i>come across</i> less of superstitious beliefs in Rome
than collectors of Folklore seem to have met in other countries. The
saying exists,</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Giorno di Venere,</p>
<p class="line">Giorno di Marte,</p>
<p class="line">Non si sposa,</p>
<p class="line">E non si parte.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e410src"
href="#xd26e410" name="xd26e410src">12</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e412" href="#xd26e412" name=
"xd26e412">xix</a>]</span></p>
<p>But I have seldom heard the lines quoted without the addition of,
&lsquo;But <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t believe in such things;&rsquo; and a
reference to the column of marriage announcements in the
&lsquo;Times&rsquo; will show that the prejudice against marrying in
the month of May is, to say the least, quite as strong among our own
most highly-educated classes.</p>
<p>It is not altogether uncommon at the Parochial Mass, to hear along
with banns of marriage and other announcements, a warning pronounced
against such and such a person whom private counsel has failed to deter
from &lsquo;dabbling in black arts;&rsquo; but from the observations
which I have had the opportunity of making such persons find their
dupes chiefly among the dissolute and non-believing. I know a very
consistently religious woman, and also singularly intelligent, who
appeared to have a salutary contempt for certain practices in which her
husband, a worthless fellow, who had long ago abandoned her and his
religion together, indulged. &lsquo;He actually believes,&rsquo; she
told me one day, &lsquo;that if you go out and stand on a cross
road&mdash;not merely where two roads happen to cross each other, but
where they actually make a perfect cross&mdash;and if at the stroke of
<i>mezzogiorno in punto</i>, you call the Devil he is bound to come to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He always kept a bag of particular herbs,&rsquo; I heard from
her another time, &lsquo;hung up over the door, all shred into the
finest bits. As he was very angry if I touched them, I one day said,
&ldquo;Why <i>do</i> you want that bundle of herbs kept just
there?&rdquo; and then he told me that it was because no witch could
pass under them without first having to count all the minute bits, and
that though it was true she might do so by her arts without taking them
down and handling them, it was yet so difficult when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e428" href="#xd26e428" name=
"xd26e428">xx</a>]</span>they were shred into such an infinite number
that it was the best preservative possible against evil
influences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another class of infrequent occurrence in the Roman stories is that
in which animals are prominent actors, other than those in which they
are transformed men. The t&aacute;tos, the enchanted horse which
excites so great enthusiasm in the Hungarian, and whose counterpart
does great wonders also in the Gaelic tales, seems to be absolutely
unknown,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e432src" href="#xd26e432" name=
"xd26e432src">13</a> as I think is also the class not uncommon in the
Gaelic (<i>e.g.</i> &lsquo;Tales of the West Highlands,&rsquo; i. 275
<i>et seq.</i>), also in the Russian Folklore, p. 338, of birds made to
pronounce articulate words analogous in sound to their own
cries.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e447src" href="#xd26e447" name=
"xd26e447src">14</a> Such traditions would naturally find a hold rather
among countrypeople than townspeople.</p>
<p>Fairies and witches are frequent enough, but the limits between the
respective domains assigned to them are not so marked as with us. Roman
fairies, it will be seen, are by no means necessarily
&lsquo;fairy-like.&rsquo; At the same time fairies, such as those
described by Mr. Campbell, &lsquo;West Highland Tales,&rsquo; p. ci.,
are altogether unknown. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e452" href=

of course, the older collections of Straparola and Basile, referred to
by Mr. Campbell and Professor De Gubernatis, not to speak of those of
Boccaccio and Sacchetti; but these were made for quite different
purposes than that of supplying Italy&rsquo;s quota to the study of
Comparative Mythology. The comparatively recent &lsquo;Collection of
Sicilian Tales,&rsquo; by Laura Gonzenbach, mentioned by Professor De
Gubernatis, I did not know of, and have not been able to see.
Straparola&rsquo;s collection seems, in Rome at least, to have fallen
into the oblivion which Mr. Campbell says is its merited lot. At least,
not only was it not mentioned to me at any of the dep&ocirc;ts where
rare books are a <i lang="fr">sp&eacute;cialit&eacute;</i>, but my
subsequent inquiry for it by name failed to produce a
copy.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e203src">&uarr;</a></p>

Alfred White told me, however, an English story of the sort, picked up
from a countryman in Berkshire. The Magpie was one day building her
nest so neatly, and whispering to herself after her wont as she laid
each straw in its place, &lsquo;This upon that, this upon that,&rsquo;
when the Woodpigeon came by. Now the Woodpigeon was young and flighty,
and had never learnt how to build a nest; but when she saw how
beautifully neat that of the Magpie looked, she thought she would like
to learn the art. The busy Magpie willingly accepted the office of
teaching her, and began a new one on purpose. Long before she was half
through, however, the flighty Woodpigeon sang out, &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll
doooo!&rsquo; The Magpie was offended at the interruption, and flew
away in dudgeon, and that&rsquo;s why the Woodpigeon always builds such
ramshackle nests. Told well; the &lsquo;This upon that!&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;That&rsquo;ll do!&rsquo; takes just the sound of the cry of each
of the birds named.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first">Once upon a time<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1349src"
href="#xd26e1349" name="xd26e1349src">1</a> there was a poor woman who
had a great fancy for eating parsley. To her it was the greatest
luxury, and as she had no garden of her own, and no money to spend on
anything not an absolute necessity of life, she had to go about
poaching in other people&rsquo;s gardens to satisfy her fancy.</p>
<p>Near her cottage was the garden of a great palace, and in this
garden grew plenty of fine parsley; but the garden was surrounded by a
wall, and to get at it she had to carry a ladder with her to get up by,
and, as soon as she had reached the top of the wall, to let it down on
the other side to get down to the parsley-bed. There was such a
quantity of parsley growing here that she thought it would never be
missed, and this made her bold, so that she went over every day and
took as much as ever she liked.</p>
<p>But the garden belonged to a witch,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1356src" href="#xd26e1356" name="xd26e1356src">2</a> who lived in
the palace, and, though she did not often walk in this part of the
garden, she knew by her supernatural powers that some one was eating
her parsley; so she came near the place one day, and lay in wait till
the poor woman came. As soon, therefore, as she came, and began eating
the parsley, the witch at once pounced down, and asked her, in her
gruff voice, what she was doing there. Though dreadfully frightened,
the poor woman thought it best to own the whole truth; so she confessed
that she came down by the ladder, adding that she had not taken
anything except the parsley, and begged forgiveness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know nothing about forgiveness,&rsquo; replied the witch.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>&lsquo;You have eaten my parsley, and must take the
consequences; and the consequences are these: I must be godmother to
your first child, be it boy or girl; and as soon as it is grown to be
of an age to dress itself without help, it must belong to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When, accordingly, the poor woman&rsquo;s first child was born, the
witch came, as she had declared she would, to be its godmother. It was
a fine little girl, and she gave it the name of Filagranata; after that
she went away again, and the poor woman saw her no more till her little
girl was grown up old enough to dress herself, and then she came and
fetched her away inexorably; nor could the poor mother, with all her
tears and entreaties, prevail on her to make any exchange for her
child.</p>
<p>So Filagranata was taken to the witch&rsquo;s palace to live, and
was put in a room in a little tower by herself, where she had to feed
the pigeons. Filagranata grew fond of her pigeons, and did not at all
complain of her work, yet, without knowing why, she began to grow quite
sad and melancholy as time went by; it was because she had no one to
play with, no one to talk to, except the witch, who was no very
delightful companion. The witch came every day, once in the day, to see
that she was attending properly to her work, and as there was no door
or staircase to the tower&mdash;this was on purpose that she might not
escape&mdash;the witch used to say when she came under the
tower&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Filagranata, so fair, so fair,</p>
<p class="line">Unloose thy tresses of golden hair:</p>
<p class="line">I, thy old grandmother, am here;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1377src" href="#xd26e1377" name="xd26e1377src">3</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">and as she said these words, Filagranata had to let
down her beautiful long hair through the window, and by it the witch
climbed up into her chamber to her. This she did every day.</p>
<p>Now, it happened that about this time a king&rsquo;s son was
travelling that way searching for a beautiful wife; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>for you know
it is the custom for princes to go searching all over the world to find
a maiden fit to be a prince&rsquo;s wife; at least they say so.</p>
<p>Well, this prince, travelling along, came by the witch&rsquo;s
palace where Filagranata was lodged. And it happened that he came that
way just as the witch was singing her ditty. If he was horrified at the
sight of the witch, he was in proportion enchanted when Filagranata
came to the window. So struck was he with the sight of her beauty, and
modesty, and gentleness, that he stopped his horse that he might watch
her as long as she stayed at the window, and thus became a spectator of
the witch&rsquo;s wonderful way of getting into the tower.</p>
<p>The prince&rsquo;s mind was soon made up to gain a nearer view of
Filagranata, and with this purpose he rode round and round the tower
seeking some mode of ingress in vain, till at last, driven to
desperation, he made up his mind that he must enter by the same strange
means as the witch herself. Thinking that the old creature had her
abode there, and that she would probably go out for some business in
the morning, and return at about the same hour as on the present
occasion, he rode away, commanding his impatience as well as he could,
and came back the next day a little earlier.</p>
<p>Though he could hardly hope quite to imitate the hag&rsquo;s rough
and tremulous voice so as to deceive Filagranata into thinking it was
really the witch, he yet made the attempt and repeated the words he had
heard&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Filagranata, thou maiden fair,</p>
<p class="line">Loose thy tresses of golden hair:</p>
<p class="line">I, thy old grandmother, am here.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Filagranata, surprised at the soft modulation of
voice, such as she had never heard before, ran quickly to the window
with a look of pleasure and astonishment which gave her face a more
winning expression than ever.</p>
<p>The prince looked up, all admiration and expectation; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>and the
thought quickly ran through Filagranata&rsquo;s head&mdash;&lsquo;I
have been taught to loose my hair whenever those words are said; why
should not I loose it to draw up such a pleasant-looking cavalier, as
well as for the ugly old hag?&rsquo; and, without waiting for a second
thought, she untied the ribbon that bound her tresses and let them fall
upon the prince. The prince was equally quick in taking advantage of
the occasion, and, pressing his knees firmly into his horse&rsquo;s
flanks, so that it might not remain below to betray him, drew himself
up, together with his steed, just as he had seen the witch do.</p>
<p>Filagranata, half frightened at what she had done the moment the
deed was accomplished, had not a word to say, but blushed and hung her
head. The prince, on the other hand, had so many words to pour out,
expressive of his admiration for her, his indignation at her captivity,
and his desire to be allowed to be her deliverer, that the moments flew
quickly by, and it was only when Filagranata found herself drawn to the
window by the power of the witch&rsquo;s magic words that they
remembered the dangerous situation in which they stood.</p>
<p>Another might have increased the peril by cries of despair, or lost
precious time in useless lamentations; but Filagranata showed a
presence of mind worthy of a prince&rsquo;s wife by catching up a wand
of the witch, with which she had seen her do wonderful things. With
this she gave the prince a little tap, which immediately changed him
into a pomegranate, and then another to the horse, which transformed
him into an orange.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1436src" href=
"#xd26e1436" name="xd26e1436src">4</a> These she set by on the shelf,
and then proceeded to draw up the witch after the usual manner.</p>
<p>The old hag was not slow in perceiving there was something unusual
in Filagranata&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a stink<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1443src" href=
"#xd26e1443" name="xd26e1443src">5</a> of Christians! What a stink of
Christians!&rsquo; she kept exclaiming, as she poked her nose into
every hole and corner. Yet she failed to find anything to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>reprehend;
for as for the beautiful ripe pomegranate and the golden orange on the
shelf, the Devil himself could not have thought there was anything
wrong with them. Thus baffled, she was obliged to finish her inspection
of the state of the pigeons, and end her visit in the usual way.</p>
<p>As soon as she was gone Filagranata knew she was free till the next
day, and so once more, with a tap of the wand, restored the horse and
his rider to their natural shapes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And this is how your life passes every day! Is it
possible?&rsquo; exclaimed the prince; &lsquo;no, I cannot leave you
here. You may be sure my good horse will be proud to bear your little
weight; you have only to mount behind me, and I will take you home to
my kingdom, and you shall live in the palace with my mother, and be my
queen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is not to be supposed but that Filagranata very much preferred
the idea of going with the handsome young prince who had shown so
devoted an appreciation of her, and being his queen, to remaining shut
up in the doorless tower and being the witch&rsquo;s menial; so she
offered no opposition, and the prince put her on to his good horse
behind him, and away they rode.</p>
<p>On, on, on,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1457src" href="#xd26e1457"
name="xd26e1457src">6</a> they rode for a long, long way, until they
came at last to a wood; but for all the good horse&rsquo;s speed, the
witch, who was not long in perceiving their escape and setting out in
pursuit, was well nigh overtaking them. Just then they saw a little old
woman<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1460src" href="#xd26e1460" name=
"xd26e1460src">7</a> standing by the way, making signs and calling to
them to arrest their course. How great soever was their anxiety to get
on, so urgent was her appeal to them to stop and listen to her that
they yielded to her entreaties. Nor were they losers by their kindness,
for the little old woman was a fairy,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1463src" href="#xd26e1463" name="xd26e1463src">8</a> and she had
stopped them, not on her own account, but to give them the means of
escaping from the witch.</p>
<p>To the prince she said: &lsquo;Take these three gifts, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>when the witch comes very near throw down first the
mason&rsquo;s trowel; and when she nearly overtakes you again throw
down the comb; and when she nearly comes upon you again after that,
throw down this jar<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1470src" href=
"#xd26e1470" name="xd26e1470src">9</a> of oil. After that she
won&rsquo;t trouble you any more.&rsquo; And to Filagranata she
whispered some words, and then let them go. But the witch was now close
behind, and the prince made haste to throw down the mason&rsquo;s
trowel. Instantly there rose up a high stone wall between them, which
it took the witch some time to climb over. Nevertheless, by her
supernatural powers she was not long in making up for the lost time,
and had soon overtaken the best speed of the good horse. Then the
prince threw down the comb, and immediately there rose up between them
a strong hedge of thorns, which it took the witch some time to make her
way through, and that only with her body bleeding all over from the
thorns. Nevertheless, by her supernatural powers she was not long in
making up for the lost time, and had soon overtaken the best speed of
the good horse. Then the prince threw down the jar of oil, and the oil
spread and spread till it had overflowed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1482src" href="#xd26e1482" name="xd26e1482src">10</a> the whole
country side; and as wherever you step in a pool of oil the foot only
slides back, the witch could never get out of that, so the prince and
Filagranata rode on in all safety towards the prince&rsquo;s
palace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now tell me what it was the old woman in the wood
whispered to you,&rsquo; said the prince, as soon as they saw their
safety sufficiently secured to breathe freely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was this,&rsquo; answered Filagranata; &lsquo;that I was
to tell you that when you arrive at your own home you must kiss no
one&mdash;no one at all, not your father, or mother, or sisters, or
anyone&mdash;till after our marriage. Because if you do you will forget
all about your love for me, and all you have told me you think of me,
and all the faithfulness you have promised me, and we shall become as
strangers again to each other.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;How dreadful!&rsquo; said the prince. &lsquo;Oh, you may be
sure I will kiss no one if <i>that</i> is to be the consequence; so be
quite easy. It will be rather odd, to be sure, to return from such a
long journey and kiss none of them at home, not even my own mother; but
I suppose if I tell them how it is they won&rsquo;t mind. So be quite
easy about that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus they rode on in love and confidence, and the good horse soon
brought them home.</p>
<p>On the steps of the palace the chancellor of the kingdom came out to
meet them, and saluted Filagranata as the chosen bride the prince was
to bring home; he informed him that the king his father had died during
his absence, and that he was now sovereign of the realm. Then he led
him in to the queen-mother, to whom he told all his adventures, and
explained why he must not kiss her till after his marriage. The
queen-mother was so pleased with the beauty, and modesty, and
gentleness of Filagranata, that she gave up her son&rsquo;s kiss
without repining, and before they retired to rest that night it was
announced to the people that the prince had returned home to be their
king, and the day was proclaimed when the feast for his marriage was to
take place.</p>
<p>Then all in the palace went to their sleeping-chambers. But the
prince, as it had been his wont from his childhood upwards, went into
his mother&rsquo;s room to kiss her after she was asleep, and when he
saw her placid brow on the pillow, with the soft white hair parted on
either side of it, and the eyes which were wont to gaze on him with so
much love, resting in sleep, he could not forbear from pressing his
lips on her forehead and giving the wonted kiss.</p>
<p>Instantly there passed from his mind all that had taken place since
he last stood there to take leave of the queen-mother before he started
on his journey. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>His visit to the witch&rsquo;s palace, his flight
from it, the life-perils by the way, and, what is more, the image of
Filagranata herself,&mdash;all passed from his mind like a vision of
the night, and when he woke up and they told him he was king, it was as
if he heard it for the first time, and when they brought Filagranata to
him it was as though he knew her not nor saw her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if I am king there must be a
queen to share my throne;&rsquo; and as a reigning sovereign could not
go over the world to seek a wife, he sent and fetched him a princess
meet to be the king&rsquo;s wife, and appointed the betrothal. The
queen-mother, who loved Filagranata, was sad, and yet nothing that she
could say could bring back to his mind the least remembrance of all he
had promised her and felt towards her.</p>
<p>But Filagranata knew that the prince had kissed his mother, and this
was why the spell was on him; so she said to her mother-in-law:
&lsquo;You get me much fine-sifted flour<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1513src" href="#xd26e1513" name="xd26e1513src">11</a> and a large
bag of sweetmeats, and I will try if I cannot yet set this matter
straight.&rsquo; So the queen-mother ordered that there should be
placed in her room much sifted flour and a large bag of sweetmeats. And
Filagranata, when she had shut close the door, set to work and made
paste of the flour, and of the paste she moulded two pigeons, and
filled them inside with the comfits. Then at the banquet of the
betrothal she asked the queen-mother to have her two pigeons placed on
the table; and she did so, one at each end. But as soon as all the
company were seated, before any one was helped, the two pigeons which
Filagranata had made began to talk to each other across the whole
length of the table: and everybody stood still with wonder to listen to
what the pigeons of paste said to each other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you remember,&rsquo; said the first pigeon, &lsquo;or is
it possible that you have really forgotten, when I was in that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>doorless tower of the witch&rsquo;s palace, and
you came under the window and imitated her voice, saying,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Filagranata, thou maiden fair,</p>
<p class="line">Loose thy tresses of golden hair:</p>
<p class="line">I, thy old grandmother, am here,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">till I drew you up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the other pigeon answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Si, signora, I remember it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And as the young king heard the second pigeon say &lsquo;Si,
signora, I remember it now,&rsquo; he, too, remembered having been in a
doorless tower, and having sung such a verse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you remember,&rsquo; continued the first pigeon,
&lsquo;how happy we were together after I drew you up into that little
room where I was confined, and you swore if I would come with you we
should always be together and never be separated from each other any
more at all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the second pigeon replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah yes! I remember it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And as the second pigeon said &lsquo;Ah yes! I remember it
now,&rsquo; there rose up in the young king&rsquo;s mind the memory of
a fair sweet face on which he had once gazed with loving eyes, and of a
maiden to whom he had sworn lifelong devotion.</p>
<p>But the first pigeon continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you remember, or have you quite forgotten, how we fled
away together, and how frightened we were when the witch pursued us,
and how we clung to each other, and vowed, if she overtook us to kill
us, we would die in each other&rsquo;s arms, till a fairy met us and
gave us the means to escape, and forbad you to kiss anyone, even your
own mother, till after our marriage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the second pigeon answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, ah yes! I remember it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And when the second pigeon said, &lsquo;Yes, ah yes! I remember it
now,&rsquo; the whole of the past came back to his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>mind,
and with it all his love for Filagranata. So he rose up<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1556src" href="#xd26e1556" name=
"xd26e1556src">12</a> and would have stroked the pigeons which had
brought it all to his mind, but when he touched them they melted away,
and the sweetmeats were scattered all over the table, and the guests
picked them up. But the prince ran in haste to fetch Filagranata, and
he brought her and placed her by his side in the banquet-hall. But the
second bride was sent back, with presents, to her own people.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so it all came right at last,&rsquo; pursued the
narrator. &lsquo;Lackaday! that there are no fairies now to make things
all happen right. There are plenty of people who seem to have the devil
in them for doing you a mischief, but there are no fairies to set
things straight again, alas!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="editorial">[I have placed this story first in order, as its
incidents ramify into half the traditionary tales with which we are
acquainted.</p>
<p class="editorial">(1.) &lsquo;Rapunzel,&rsquo; No. 12 in
&lsquo;Grimm,&rsquo; is the most like it among the German in the
beginning, and has the most dissimilar ending. The counterpart form, in
which it is some misdeed or ill-luck of the father instead of the
mother, which involves the surrender of the first-born, is the more
frequent opening, as in &lsquo;The Water King,&rsquo; Ralston&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Russian Folk Tales,&rsquo; p. 120. &lsquo;The Lassie and her
Godmother,&rsquo; in Dr. Dasent&rsquo;s &lsquo;Norse Tales,&rsquo; has
an opening like &lsquo;Filagranata,&rsquo; which, as it proceeds,
connects it with &lsquo;Marienkind,&rsquo; No. 4 in
&lsquo;Grimm;&rsquo; and the prohibition to open the room, in that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>one, carries on the connexion to another group,
the Bluebeard group, represented in this series by &lsquo;Monsoo
Mostro,&rsquo; &lsquo;R&egrave; Moro,&rsquo; &amp;c.; while, further
on, &lsquo;Lassie and her Godmother&rsquo; evolves the incident of the
reflection in the well, which connects it with the following story in
this collection, and in this roundabout way, though not in direct form,
with the termination of &lsquo;Filagranata.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="editorial">(2.) The introduction of an orange as a help to
defy the &lsquo;orca,&rsquo; connects the story again with the two next
(though the fruit is used differently), and with a vast number of
myths, as pointed out in Campbell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tales of the West
Highlands,&rsquo; Introduction, pp. lxxx-lxxxv. I was rather put off
the scent by the narrator using the word portogallo: melagranata,
though properly a pomegranate, is, I think, used in old Italian for an
orange, being simply a red, or golden, apple.</p>
<p class="editorial">(3.) The three gifts of the trowel, the comb, and
the oil-filler, again bring this story in connexion with another vast
group. Compare &lsquo;Campbell,&rsquo; iv. 290; also his remarks, i.
58&ndash;62, on the &lsquo;Battle of the Birds,&rsquo; which story this
resembles in the main, but, as will be found throughout this
collection, the Roman form is milder. The prince wins his bride without
performing tasks, and the couple, in escaping, have only to kill a
strange &lsquo;orca,&rsquo; and not the girl&rsquo;s own father. In the
third version of the tale in Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s series, the girl
becomes a poultry-maid, and has three fine dresses, constituting a link
with another group&mdash;that of Cinderella (I have given the Tirolean
one as &lsquo;Klein-Else&rsquo; in &lsquo;Household Stories from the
Land of Hofer&rsquo;); and the three dresses there (though not in the
Gaelic story) representing the sun, moon, and stars, give it another
connexion with &lsquo;Marienkind.&rsquo; &lsquo;The Master Maid,&rsquo;
in Dr. Dasent&rsquo;s collection, again, has the golden apple (though
it assists in a different way) and the ending of the Roman version (a
golden cock there taking the part of the two paste pigeons), but begins
with the tasks in the &lsquo;Giant&rsquo;s House&rsquo; of the Gaelic
version, which the Roman ignores.</p>
<p class="editorial">In the Russian story of &lsquo;Baba Yaga&rsquo;
(Ralston&rsquo;s &lsquo;Russian Folk Tales,&rsquo; pp. 139) we have the
three magic gifts. Though Mr. Campbell has a very ingenious solution
for the idea of the supernatural attaching to swords (i. lxxii), the
same does not seem at all to explain the introduction of supernatural
combs; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>when I once found a comb transformed into a
mountain in a Tirolean story, I thought, as Mr. Ralston has also
suggested (p. 144), that it fitted very well with the German expression
for a mountain-ridge; but he does not tell us whether the metaphor
holds good in Russ, where he finds it used; and in the present instance
it is a hedge of thorns into which the comb resolves itself. I have
another Roman story, in which the comb &lsquo;swelled and swelled till
every one of its teeth became a pier, and the spaces between them were
arches, and it was a bridge by which one could pass over.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="editorial">(4.) The kiss which brings forgetfulness, again,
is found in the myths of every country. It occurs in the Tirolean story
I have given as the &lsquo;Dove-Maiden&rsquo; in &lsquo;Household
Stories from the Land of Hofer,&rsquo; though I had to omit it there
for want of space; but the remaining episodes of that story are nearly
identical with those of the Russian story of &lsquo;The
Water-King;&rsquo; and in the Tirolean story the maiden is fetched from
a heathen magician&rsquo;s house by the aid of saints, while in the
others it is from giants&rsquo; or witches&rsquo; abodes, by aid of
other giants and witches. Mr. Ralston supplies, at pp. 132&ndash;7, a
long list of variants of this story, and in a Russian one, at p. 133,
comes a ride on a Bear, which is one of the incidents in the
&lsquo;Dove-Maiden,&rsquo; though, if I remember right, it does not
occur in any of the others. In Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s notes to &lsquo;The
Battle of the Birds&rsquo; are also collected notices of variants of
this episode.</p>
<p class="editorial">The affinity of this story with others again will
be found in Mr. Cox&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mythology of the Aryan
Nations,&rsquo; ii. p. 301.]</p>

expression employed in this place was &lsquo;Orca;&rsquo; as this is a
word of most frequent, but somewhat capricious use, I interrupted the
narrator to inquire her conception of it. &lsquo;Well, it means a
species of beast,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;but you see it must have been
a bewitched (&lsquo;fatata&rsquo;) beast, because the story says it was
so rich, and had a palace, and spoke and did all the things you shall
hear.&rsquo; She did not, however, seem to identify it with the evil
principle according to its undoubted derivation, nor did she allow
either that it had any connexion with &lsquo;orso,&rsquo; a bear, as
the narrator of the &lsquo;<span lang="it">il Vaso di
Persa</span>&rsquo; had expounded it, and indeed as the details of that
story required; it will be seen, therefore, that popular fancy invests
the monster with various shapes. The story of &lsquo;The Pot of
Marjoram,&rsquo; it will be seen, contains one or two incidents in
common with this one. The apparently insignificant detail of the little
plant&mdash;on which, however, both stories rest for a
foundation&mdash;is noteworthy, the narrator in each instance being
most positive that it was the one she had named and no other, and in
both cases insisting on showing me the plant, that there might be no
mistake about it. (See note to the word &lsquo;Persa,&rsquo; infra, p.

hunt.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1590src" href="#xd26e1590" name=
"xd26e1590src">2</a> It was a winter&rsquo;s day, and the ground was
covered with snow, so that when he brought down the birds with his
arquebuse the red blood made beautiful bright marks on the dazzling
white snow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How beautiful!&rsquo; exclaimed the prince. &lsquo;Never will
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>I marry till I find one with a complexion fair as
this snow, and tinted like this rosy blood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When his day&rsquo;s sport was at an end, he went home and told his
parents that he was going to wander over the world till he found one
fair as snow, tinted like rosy blood. The parents approved his design
and sent him forth.</p>
<p>On, on, on he went, till one day he met a little old woman, who
stopped him, saying: &lsquo;Whither so fast, fair prince?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He replied, &lsquo;I walk the earth till I find one who is fair as
snow, tinted like rosy blood, to make her my wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That can I help you to, and I alone,&rsquo; said the little
old woman, who was a fairy; and then she gave him the three
love-oranges, telling him that when he opened one such a maiden as he
was in search of would appear, but he must immediately look for water
and sprinkle her, or she would disappear again.</p>
<p>The prince took the oranges, and wandered on. On, on, on he went,
till at last the fancy took him to break open one of the oranges.
Immediately a beautiful maiden appeared, whose complexion was indeed
fair as snow, and tinted like rosy blood, but it was only when she had
already disappeared that he recollected about the water. It was too
late, so on he wandered again till the fancy took him to open another
orange. Instantly another maiden appeared, fairer than the other, and
he lost no time in looking for water to sprinkle her, but there was
none, and before he came back from the search she was gone.</p>
<p>On he wandered again till he was nearly home, when one day he
noticed a handsome fountain standing by the road, and over against it a
fine palace. The sight of the fountain made him think of his third
orange, and he took it out and broke it open.</p>
<p>Instantly a third maiden appeared, far fairer than either of the
others; with the water of the fountain he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>sprinkled her the moment
she appeared, and she vanished not, but staid with him and loved
him.</p>
<p>Then he said, &lsquo;You must stay here in this bower while I go on
home and fetch a retinue worthy to escort you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a palace opposite the fountain lived a black Saracen
woman,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1618src" href="#xd26e1618" name=
"xd26e1618src">3</a> and just then she went down to the fountain to
draw water, and as she looked into the water she said, &lsquo;My
mistress says that I am so ugly, but I am so fair, therefore I break
the pitcher and the little pitcher.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1621src" href="#xd26e1621" name="xd26e1621src">4</a></p>
<p>Then she looked up in the bower, and seeing the beautiful maiden,
she called her down, and caressed her, and stroked her hair, and
praised her beauty; but as she stroked her hair she took out a magic
pin, and stuck it into her head, and instantly the maiden became a dove
and perched on the side of the fountain.</p>
<p>Then she broke the pitcher and the little pitcher, and the prince
came back.</p>
<p>When the prince saw the ugly black woman standing in the bower where
he had left his beautiful maiden, he was quite bewildered, and looked
all about for her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am she whom you seek, prince,&rsquo; said the woman.
&lsquo;It is the sun has changed me thus while standing here waiting
for you; but all will come right when I get away from the
sun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prince did not know what to make of it, but there was no help
for it but to take her and trust to her coming right when she got away
from the sun. He took her home, therefore, and right grand preparations
were made for the royal marriage. Tapestries were hung on the walls,
and flowers strewed the floor, while in the kitchen was the cook as
busy as a bee, preparing I know not how many dishes for the royal
banquet.</p>
<p>Then, lo, there came and perched on the kitchen window a little
dove, and sang, &lsquo;Cook, cook, for whom are you cooking; for the
son of the king, or the Saracen Moor? May the cook fall asleep, and may
all the viands be burnt!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1652src"

"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p>After this nothing would go right in the kitchen; every day all the
dishes got burnt, and it was impossible to give the wedding banquet,
because there was nothing fit to send up to the table. Then the
king&rsquo;s son came into the kitchen to learn what had happened, and
they showed him the dove which had done all. &lsquo;Sweet little
dove!&rsquo; said the prince, and, catching it in his hand, began to
caress it; thus he felt the pin in its head, and pulled it out.
Instantly his own fair maiden stood before him, white as snow, rosy as
blood. Then the mystery was cleared up, and there was great rejoicing,
and the old witch was burnt.</p>
<p class="editorial">[This story, besides its similarities with those
mentioned in note of the foregoing, is substantially the same as
&lsquo;<span lang="de">Die weisse u. die schwarze Braut</span>&rsquo;
in Grimm (with his &lsquo;<span lang="de">Schneeweisschen u.
Rosenroth</span>&rsquo; it seems to have nothing in common, though the
words &lsquo;Snow-white and rose-red&rsquo; suggest it); but its
commencement is different. The German Tale of Sneewittchen (Grimm,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>p. 206 has also much similarity with it: a queen
sat working in a window framed with ebony; she pricks her finger, and
three drops of blood that fall on the snow suggest the wish that her
child may be fair as snow, red as blood, and her hair as dark as ebony.
Her wishes are fulfilled, and she dies. She is succeeded by a
witch-stepmother, from whom the child of wishes suffers many things,
but the witch is ultimately danced to death in red-hot iron shoes. A
link between them is supplied by the next following, in which the
opening agrees with the German story. In Schneller&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Legends of the Italian Tirol&rsquo; are two, with a title
similar to the Roman one. In the first (&lsquo;I tre aranci&rsquo;) the
girl becomes the property of a fairy, as in Filagranata. She is sent to
fetch three oranges, which she does by the help of five gifts given her
by an old man; but the whole ends in the good child wishing as her only
reward to be restored to her mother. The other is called
&lsquo;L&rsquo;amor dei tre aranci.&rsquo; In this the prince breaks a

getting into a scrape with a witch, this time by breaking her basket of
eggs. His punishment is the fulfilment of his first wish, and his first
wish happens to be a pettish one, that the earth might swallow up his
three sisters; as one of them is said to be always dressed like the
sun, the second like the moon, and the third like the stars, we have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=

Klein-Else. Afterwards Iron Ladislas goes in search of his sisters, and
encounters many heroic adventures and many transformations, in one of
which a tree in a dragon&rsquo;s garden with golden apples is a
prominent detail.</p>
<p class="editorial">A tree with golden fruit is also an important
incident in the principal and most popular of Hungarian myths, that of

appears in the first as the Goddess or Queen of Summer held in thrall
by the stern witch the Goddess or Queen of Winter. She is seen planting
in the territory of the Earth-King a tree which represents her earnest
longings after freedom, and committing it to the benign influence of
the Sun-King.</p>
<p class="editorial">The second shows this mystical tree bearing its
golden fruit, which the beautiful Fairy, as if ashamed of her boldness,
is hasting to pluck off, borne on a chariot formed of obedient swans.
The Wind-genius wafts poppy seeds over the eyes of the armed guard the
Winter-Queen had set round the tree, and lulls them to sleep.</p>
<p class="editorial">In the third Argilus, the Earth-Prince, is seen
surprising in his (up till then vain) nightly attempt to gather the
golden fruit, <span lang="hu"><span class="corr" id="xd26e1725" title=

coy plunderer; then suddenly a glance from her pierces his heart
instead, and he lets the arrow harmlessly strike the ground.</p>
<p class="editorial">The fourth portrays the happy union of
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1730" title="Source: Illona">Ilona</span>
and Argilus, Summer and Earth; but the Winter-Queen comes by enraged at
their successful defiance of her, and cuts off <span class="corr" id=

beautiful golden locks. (The people have it that these locks borne
along by the winds planted the Puszta with the beautiful long feathery
grass which they call &lsquo;Orphan-girl&rsquo;s hair&rsquo;). In the
distance are seen the parents of the Earth-Prince hurrying forward in
search of their son.</p>

Ilona</span></span> waking from her delicious slumber, and on
discovering the loss of the mantle of her hair, hasting back in agony

and prays her to remain always with him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

of the Earth-King. Prince Argilus is taking leave of his parents as he
starts on his perilous journey, determined to deliver the captive

throw down masses of rock upon him, but he spreads out the conjuring
mantle, and committing himself to it, floats securely through the
air.</p>
<p class="editorial">In the ninth Argilus has reached the
Winter-Witch&rsquo;s border, and prepares to engage in combat with the
dragon who guards it.</p>
<p class="editorial">The tenth is highly sensational. The Winter-Witch
has thrown a deep sleep over him, and the poor Summer-Fairy strives to

<p class="first">They say there was a peasant whose wife had died and
left him one little girl, who was the most beautiful creature that ever
was seen; no one on earth could compare with her for beauty. After a
while the peasant married again: this time he married a peasant-woman
who had a daughter who was the most deformed object that ever was seen;
no cripple on earth could compare with her for deformity; and,
moreover, her skin was quite black and shrivelled, and altogether no
one could bear to look at her, she was so hideous.</p>
<p>One day when everyone was out, and only the fair daughter at home,
the king came by from hunting thirsty, and he stopped at the cottage
and asked the fair maid for a glass of water. When he saw how fair she
was and with what grace she waited on him, he said, &lsquo;Fair maiden,
if you will, I will come back in eight days and make you my
wife.&rsquo; The maiden answered, &lsquo;Indeed I will it, your
Majesty!&rsquo; and the king rode away.</p>
<p>When the stepmother came home the simple maiden told her all that
had happened, and she answered her deceitfully, congratulating her on
her good fortune. Before the day came round, however, she shut the fair
maiden in the cellar. When the king came she went out to meet him with
a smiling face, saying, &lsquo;Good day, Sire! What is your royal
pleasure?&rsquo; And the king answered, &lsquo;To marry your daughter
am I come.&rsquo; Then the stepmother brought out her own daughter to
him, all wrapped up in a wide mantle, and her face covered with a thick
veil, and a hood over that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rest assured, good woman, that your daughter will be my
tenderest care,&rsquo; said the king; &lsquo;but you must take those
wrappers off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By no means, Sire!&rsquo; exclaimed the stepmother.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>&lsquo;And beware you do it not. You have seen how
fair she is above all the children of earth. But this exceeding beauty
she has on one condition. If one breath of air strike her she loses it
all. Therefore, Oh, king! let not the veil be removed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard that he called for another veil, and another
hood, and wrapping her still more carefully round, handed her into the
carriage he had brought for her, shut the door close, and rode away on
horseback by her side.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the palace the hideous daughter of the
stepmother was married to the king all wrapt up in her veils.</p>
<p>The stepmother, however, went into her room, full of triumph at what
she had done. &lsquo;But what am I to do with the other girl!&rsquo;
she said to herself; &lsquo;somehow or other some day she will get out
of the cellar, and the king will see her, and it will be worse for my
daughter than before.&rsquo; And as she knew not what to do she went to
a witch to help her. &lsquo;This is what you must do,&rsquo; said the
witch; &lsquo;take this pin&rsquo; (and she gave her a long pin with a
gold head), &lsquo;and put it into the head of the maiden, and she will
become a dove. Then have ready a cage, and keep her in it, and no one
will ever see her for a maiden more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The stepmother went therefore, and bought a cage, and taking the
large pin<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1804src" href="#xd26e1804" name=
"xd26e1804src">2</a> down into the cellar, she drove the pin into the
fair maiden&rsquo;s head, holding open the cage as she did so.</p>
<p>As soon as the pin entered the maiden&rsquo;s head she became a
dove, but instead of flying into the cage she flew over the
stepmother&rsquo;s head far away out of sight.</p>
<p>On she flew till she came to the king&rsquo;s palace, right against
the window of the kitchen where the cook was ready preparing a great
dinner for the king. The cook looked round as he heard the poor little
dove beating its frightened breast against the window, and, fearful
lest it should hurt itself, he opened the window. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>In flew the dove as soon as he opened the window, and flew three
times round his head, singing each time as she did so:&mdash;&lsquo;O
cook! O cook! of the royal kitchen, what shall we do with the Queen?
All of you put yourselves to sleep, and may the dinner be burnt
up!<span class="corr" id="xd26e1818" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1820src"
href="#xd26e1820" name="xd26e1820src">3</a></p>
<p>As soon as she had sung this the third time the cook sank into a
deep sleep; the dinner from want of attention was all burnt up; and
when the king sat down to table, there was nothing to set before
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is the dinner?&rsquo; exclaimed the king, as he looked
over the empty table to which he had brought his bride, still wrapt up
in her thick veils.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please your Majesty, the dinner is all burnt up as black as
charcoal,&rsquo; said the chamberlain; &lsquo;and the cook sits in the
kitchen so fast asleep that no one can wake him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go and fetch me a dinner from the inn,&rsquo; said the king;
&lsquo;and the cook, when he comes to himself, let him be brought
before me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a time the cook came to himself, and the chamberlain brought
him before the king.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me how this happened,&rsquo; said the king to the cook.
&lsquo;All these years you have served me well and faithfully; how is
it that to-day, when the dinner should have been of the best in honour
of my bride, everything is burnt up, and the king&rsquo;s table is left
empty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, the dinner had been of the best, Sire,&rsquo;
answered the cook. &lsquo;So had I prepared it. Only, when all was
nearly ready, there came a dove flying in at the window, and flew three
times round my head, singing each time,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Cook of the royal kitchen,</p>
<p class="line xd26e1680">What shall we do with the Queen?</p>
<p class="line">Sleep ye all soundly, and burnt be the meal</p>
<p class="line xd26e1680">Which on the King&rsquo;s board should have

</div>
<p class="first">After that a deep sleep fell on me and I know nothing
more of what happened.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href=
"#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;That must have been a singular dove,&rsquo; said the king;
&lsquo;bring her to me and you shall be forgiven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The cook went down to look for the dove, and found her midway,
flying to meet him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is the dove, Sire,&rsquo; said the cook, handing the
dove to the king.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you spoilt my dinner, did you palombelletta,&rsquo; said
the king. &lsquo;But never mind; you are a dear little dove, and I
forgive you,&rsquo; and he put her in his breast and stroked her. Thus,
as he went on stroking and fondling her, calling her
&lsquo;palombelletta bella!&rsquo; he felt the gold head of the
stepmother&rsquo;s big pin through the feathers. &lsquo;What have you
got in your head, palombelletta dear?&rsquo; he said, and pulled the
pin out.</p>
<p>Instantly the fair maiden stood before him in all her surpassing
beauty as he had seen her at the first. &lsquo;Are you not my fair
maiden who promised to marry me?&rsquo; exclaimed the king.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very same, and no other,&rsquo; replied the maiden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then who is this one?&rsquo; said the king, and he turned to
the stepmother&rsquo;s daughter beside him, and tore off her veil. Then
he understood the deceit that had been played on him, and he sent for
the stepmother, and ordered that she and her daughter should be
punished with death.</p>

<p class="editorial">[The next group most prolific in variety of
incidents is that in which the stepmother represents the evil genius of
the story; sometimes there is a daughter only, sometimes a daughter and
a son, and sometimes, but less frequent, a son only. Allied to it is
that in which the character devolves on two elder sisters, not
specified to be stepsisters, and the incidents in these two branches
are closely interwoven. I give the first place to Cinderella, because
it has acquired a homely importance.]</p>

<p class="first">They say there was a merchant who had three daughters.
When he went out into foreign countries to buy wares he told them he
would bring them rare presents whatever they might ask for. The eldest
asked for precious jewels, the second for rich shawls, but the youngest
who was always kept out of sight in the kitchen by the others, and made
to do the dirty work of the house, asked only for a little bird.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you want a little bird, do you! What is the use of a
little bird to you!&rsquo; said the sisters mocking her, and
&lsquo;Papa will have something else to think of than minding little
birds on a long journey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you will bring me a little bird, won&rsquo;t you,
papa?&rsquo; pleaded the little girl; &lsquo;and I can tell you that if
you don&rsquo;t the boat you are on will stand still, and will neither
move backwards nor forwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The merchant went away into a far country and bought precious wares,
but he forgot all about the little bird. It was only when he had got on
board a boat to go down a mighty river on his homeward way, and the
captain found the boat would not move by any means, that he remembered
what his daughter had said to him. Then while the captain was wondering
how it was the boat would not move, he went to him and told him what he
had done. But the captain said, &lsquo;That is easily set right. Here
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>close by is a garden full of thousands of birds;
you can easily creep in and carry off one. <i>One</i> will never be
missed among so many thousands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The merchant followed his directions and went into the garden where
there were so many thousand birds that he easily caught one. The
captain gave him a cage, and he brought it safely home and gave it to
his daughter.</p>
<p>That night the elder sisters said as usual, &lsquo;We are going to
the ball; you will stay at home and sweep up the place and mind the
fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now all the birds in the garden which the captain had pointed out to
the merchant were fairies; so when the others were gone to the ball and
the youngest daughter went into her room to her bird, she said to
it:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Give me splendid raiment,</p>
<p class="line">And I will give you my rags.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1920src" href="#xd26e1920" name="xd26e1920src">2</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Immediately, the bird gave her the most beautiful suit
of clothes, with jewels and golden slippers, and a splendid carriage
and prancing horses. With these the maiden went to the ball which was
at the king&rsquo;s palace. The moment the king saw her he fell in love
with her, and would dance with no one else. The sisters were furious
with the stranger because the king danced all night with her and not
with them, but they had no idea it was their sister.</p>
<p>The second night she did the same, only the bird gave her a yet more
beautiful dress, and the king did all he could to find out who she was,
but she would not tell him. Then he asked her name and she
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They call me <i>Cenorientola</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Cenorientola</i>,&rsquo; said the king; &lsquo;what a
pretty name! I never heard it before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had also told the servants that they must run after her carriage
and see where it went; but though they ran as fast as the wind they
could not come near the pace of her horses.</p>
<p>The third night the sisters went to the ball and left <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>her at
home, and she staid at home with her little bird and said to
it,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Give me splendid raiment,</p>
<p class="line">And I will give you my rags.<a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<p class="first">Then the bird gave her a more splendid suit still, and
the king paid her as much attention as ever. But to the servants he had
said, &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t follow fast enough tonight to see where
she lives I will have all your heads cut off.&rsquo; So they used such
extra diligence that she in her hurry to get away dropped one of her
golden slippers; this the servants picked up and brought to the
king.</p>
<p>The next day the king sent a servant into every house in the city
till he should find her whom the golden slipper fitted, but there was
not one; last of all he came to the merchant&rsquo;s house, and he
tried it on the two elder daughters and it would fit neither. Then he
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There must be some other maiden in this house;&rsquo; but
they only shrugged their shoulders. &lsquo;It is impossible; another
maiden there must be, for every maiden in the city we have seen and the
slipper fits none, therefore one there must be here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then they said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In truth we have a little sister who sits in the kitchen and
does the work. She is called <i lang="it">Cenorientola</i>, because she
is always smutty. We are sure she never went to a ball, and it would
only soil the beautiful gold slipper to let her put her smutty feet
into it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may be so,&rsquo; replied the king&rsquo;s servant,
&lsquo;but we must try, nevertheless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they fetched her, and the king&rsquo;s servant found that the
shoe fitted her; and they went and told the king all.</p>
<p>The moment the king heard them say <i lang="it">Cenorientola</i> he
said,&mdash;&lsquo;That is she! It is the name she gave me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he sent a carriage to fetch her in all haste. The bird meantime
had given her a more beautiful dress than any she had had before, and
priceless jewels, so that when they came to fetch her she looked quite
fit to be a queen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29"
name="pb29">29</a>]</span>Then the king married her; and though her
sisters had behaved so ill to her she gave them two fine estates, so
that all were content.</p>
<p class="editorial">[The counterparts to the story are endless. In
Grimm&rsquo;s &lsquo;Aschenputtel&rsquo; (p. 93), the nominal German
counterpart, there is a stepmother as well as two sisters, and the
story turns upon the gifts each daughter craves of the father, an
episode which occurs in Roman versions with different titles. His
&lsquo;<span lang="de">Die drei M&auml;nnlein im Walde</span>&rsquo;
(&lsquo;Three Little Men in the Wood&rsquo;) is like it, and the other
versions too, and the episode in it of the good daughter receiving the
faculty of dropping a gold coin from her mouth at every word she
utters, is like a Hungarian story, in which no stepmother figures, but
the evil genius of the story (the Lady-in-Waiting) is plainly called a
witch. In this story it is a princess, from whose footsteps rise gold
pieces, her tears are pearls, and her smiles rosebuds. In one of the
Siddhi K&uuml;r Stories which I have translated as &lsquo;Sagas from
the far East&rsquo; (p. 49) is a similar incident, and a Spanish
equivalent in Note 3. A friend of mine met with a very similar legend
in a convent at Quito, concerning a nun called &lsquo;the Rose of
Quito,&rsquo; out of whose grave a rose-tree is said to have sprung and
blossomed on the morrow of her burial. It seems, however, to have an
independent origin, as &lsquo;the Rose of Quito&rsquo; died within the
last 150 years. In the Tirolean &lsquo;Klein-Else,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Aschenpf&ouml;dl,&rsquo; to which allusion has already been
made, and which answers to it in name, we have a connexion with the
last group (as in some of the succeeding Roman versions) in the sun,
moon, and star dresses.</p>
<p class="editorial">Among the Tales of Italian Tirol we find it as
<i>Zendrarola</i>, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30"
name="pb30">30</a>]</span>with a good deal of variation from any other
form I have met. The story opens with a dying father as in the North
Tirolean &lsquo;Klein-Else,&rsquo; but it is only a rich man, not a
warrior-baron, and he has three daughters instead of one. He bids them
choose what gifts he shall bestow on them before he dies, and the
eldest asks for a pair of earrings; the second for a dress; and the
youngest for his magic sword, which gives whatever the possessor wishes
for. The story is singular in this, that the elder sisters seem to have
no spite. The father does not die; but, notwithstanding his recovery,
he has nothing more to do with the story further than to give an
unwilling consent that the youngest daughter, though his favourite,
shall go forth with her sword and roam the world till she finds a
husband. She only takes service in a large house in a big town,
however; but there falls in love with a melancholy youth, son of a
count, who lives opposite. For the sake of being nearer him, she
obtains the place of kitchen-maid in his palace, and thus acquires her
title of Zendrarola in a very different way from her counterparts in
other lands. One day she hears he is going to a ball, and she makes her
wishing-sword give her a dress like the sky; and the young Count, who
has never admired anyone before, of course falls in love with her. When
he comes back, he confides to his lady mother what has occurred, and
Zendrarola, now again dressed as a dirty drudge, interposes that the
fair one he was extolling was not prettier than herself. He silences
her indignantly by giving her a poke with the shovel, and when she
meets him next night in some beautiful attire, and he asks her where
she comes from, she answers &lsquo;<i>dalla palettada</i>&rsquo; (from
shovel-blow). The next day the same thing happens, and he gives her a
blow with the tongs, and when he asks her in the evening what her
country is, she answers &lsquo;<i>majettada</i>&rsquo; (tongs-blow);
answering to <i>Frustinaia</i> and <i>Stivalaia</i> in the second Roman
version of &lsquo;Maria di Legno.&rsquo; He gives her a ring, which she
sends up in his broth, as Klein-Else does in the pancake, and so he
recognises and marries her. In one or two of the Roman versions also,
the means of recognition is a ring in place of a slipper.</p>
<p class="editorial">I do not remember any Cinderella among the Russian
Tales, though there are stepmother stories, which pair off with others
of the Roman. For Scotch versions I must refer the reader to
Campbell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Highland Tales,&rsquo; i. 226, and ii. 292.]

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They say there was once a husband and a wife; but I
don&rsquo;t mean that they were husband and wife of each other. The
husband had lost his wife, and the wife had lost her husband, and each
had one little daughter. The husband sent his daughter to the wife to
be brought up along with her own daughter, and as the girl came every
morning to be trained and instructed, the wife used to send a message
back by her every evening, saying, &lsquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t your father
marry me? then we should all live together, and you would no longer
have this weary walk to take.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The father, however, did not see it in the same light; but the
teacher<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2046src" href="#xd26e2046" name=
"xd26e2046src">2</a> continued sending the same message. In
short,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2049src" href="#xd26e2049" name=
"xd26e2049src">3</a> at last she carried her point, having previously
given a solemn promise to him that Maria, his little girl, should be
always as tenderly treated as her own.</p>
<p>Not many months elapsed, however, before she began to show herself a
true stepmother. After treating Maria with every kind of harshness, she
at last sent her out into the Campagna to tend the cow, so as to keep
her out of sight of her father, and estrange him from her. Maria had to
keep the cow&rsquo;s stall clean with fresh litter every day; sometimes
she had to take the cow out to grass, and watch that it only grazed
over the right piece of land; at other times she had to go out and cut
grass for the cow to eat. All this was work enough for one so young;
but Maria was a kind-hearted girl, and grew fond of her cow, so that it
became a pleasure to her to attend to it.</p>
<p>When the cruel stepmother saw this she was annoyed to find her so
light-hearted over her work, and to vex her more gave her a great heap
of hemp to spin. It was in vain that Maria reminded her she had never
been taught to spin; the only answer she got was, &lsquo;If you
don&rsquo;t bring it home with you to-night all properly spun you will
be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>finely punished;&rsquo; and Maria knew to her cost
what that meant.</p>
<p>When Maria went out into the Campagna that day she was no longer
light-hearted; and as she littered down the stall she stroked the cow
fondly, and said to her, as she had no one else to complain to,
&lsquo;Vaccarella! Vaccarella! what shall I do? I have got all this
hemp to spin, and I never learnt spinning. Yet if I don&rsquo;t get
through it somehow I shall get sadly beaten to-night. Dear little cow,
tell me what to do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the cow was an enchanted cow,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2062src" href="#xd26e2062" name="xd26e2062src">4</a> and when she
heard Maria cry she turned round and said quickly and
positively:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Throw it on to the horns of me,</p>
<p class="line">And go along, cut grass for me!<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2070src" href="#xd26e2070" name="xd26e2070src">5</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Maria did as she was told, went out and cut a good
basketful of grass, and imagine her delight on coming back with it to
find all the whole lot of hemp beautifully spun.</p>
<p>The surprise of the stepmother was still greater than hers, at
finding that she had got through her task so easily, for she had given
her enough to have occupied an ordinary person a week. Next day,
therefore, she determined to vex her with a more difficult task, and
gave her a quantity of spun hemp<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2087src"
href="#xd26e2087" name="xd26e2087src">6</a> to weave into a piece of
fine cloth. Maria&rsquo;s pleadings were as fruitless as before, and
once more she went to tell her tale of woe to her &lsquo;dear little
cow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Vaccarella readily gave the same answer as before:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Throw it on to the horns of me,</p>
<p class="line">And go along, cut grass for me!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Once more, when Maria came back with her basket of
grass, she found all her work done, to her great surprise and delight.
But her stepmother&rsquo;s surprise was quite of another order. That
Maria should have woven the cloth, not only without instruction, but
even without a loom, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33"
name="pb33">33</a>]</span>proved clearly enough she must have had some
one to help her&mdash;a matter which roused the stepmother&rsquo;s
jealousy in the highest degree, and wherein this help consisted she
determined to find out. Accordingly, next day she gave her a shirt to
make up, and then posted herself out of sight in a corner of the
cow-house to see what happened. Thus she overheard Maria&rsquo;s
complaint to her dear little cow, and Vaccarella&rsquo;s
reply:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Throw it on to the horns of me,</p>
<p class="line">And go along, cut grass for me!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">She thus also saw, what Maria did not see, that as
soon as she had gone out the cow assumed the form of a woman, and sat
down and stitched and stitched away till the shirt was made, and that
in a surprisingly short space of time. As soon as it was finished, and
before Maria came in, the woman became a cow again.</p>
<p>The cruel stepmother determined that Maria should be deprived of a
friend who enabled her to set all her hard treatment at defiance, and
next morning told her that she was going to kill the cow. Maria was
broken-hearted at the announcement, but she knew it was useless to
remonstrate; so she only used her greatest speed to reach her
&lsquo;dear little cow,&rsquo; and warn her of what was going to happen
in time to make her escape.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no need for me to escape,&rsquo; replied Vaccarella;
&lsquo;killing will not hurt me. So dry your tears, and don&rsquo;t be
distressed. Only, after they have killed me, put your hand under my
heart, and there you will find a golden ball. This ball is yours, so
take it out, and whenever you are tired of your present kind of life,
you have only to say to it on some fitting occasion&mdash;&ldquo;Golden
ball, golden ball, dress me in gold and give me a
lover,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2113src" href="#xd26e2113"
name="xd26e2113src">7</a> and you shall see what shall
happen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Vaccarella had no time to say more, for the stepmother arrived just
then with a man who slaughtered the cow at her order. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>Under Vaccarella&rsquo;s heart Maria found the promised golden ball,
which she hid away carefully against some fitting occasion for using it
arose.</p>
<p>Not long after there was a <i>novena</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2136src" href="#xd26e2136" name="xd26e2136src">8</a> of a great
festival, during which Maria&rsquo;s stepmother, with all her
disposition to overwork her, durst not keep her from church, lest the
neighbours should cry &lsquo;Shame!&rsquo; on her.</p>
<p>Maria accordingly went to church with all the rest of the people,
and when she had made her way through the crowd to a little distance
from her stepmother, she took her golden ball out of her pocket and
whispered to it&mdash;&lsquo;Golden ball, golden ball, dress me in gold
and give me a lover.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the golden ball burst gently open and enveloped her, and
she came out of it all radiant with beautiful clothing, like a
princess. Everybody made way for her in her astonishing brightness.</p>
<p>The eyes of the king&rsquo;s son were turned upon her, no less than
the eyes of all the people; and the prayers were no sooner over than he
sent some of his attendants to call her and bring her to him. Before
they could reach her, however, Maria had restored her beautiful raiment
to the golden ball, and, in the sordid attire in which her stepmother
dressed her, she could easily pass through the crowd unperceived.</p>
<p>At home, her stepmother could not forbear talking, like everyone
else in the town, about the maiden in glittering raiment who had
appeared in the midst of the church; but, of course, without the
remotest suspicion that it was Maria herself. But Maria sat still and
said nothing.</p>
<p>So it happened each day of the Novena; for, though Maria was not at
all displeased with the appearance and fame of the husband whom her
&lsquo;dear little cow&rsquo; seemed to have appointed for her, she did
not wish to be too easy a prize, and thought it but right to make him
take a little trouble to win her. Thus she every day restored all her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>bright clothing to the golden ball before the
prince&rsquo;s men could overtake her. Only on the last day of the
Novena, when the prince, fearful lest it might also be the last on
which he would have an opportunity of seeing her, had told them to use
extra diligence, they were so near overtaking her that, in the hurry of
the moment, she dropped a slipper.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2152src"
href="#xd26e2152" name="xd26e2152src">9</a> This the prince&rsquo;s men
eagerly seized, feeling no compunction in wresting it from the
mean-looking wench (so Maria now looked) who disputed possession of it
with them, not in the least imagining that she could be the radiant
being of whom they were in search.</p>
<p>The Novena over, Maria once more returned to her ceaseless toil; but
the stepmother&rsquo;s hatred had grown so great that she determined to
rid herself of her altogether and in the most cruel way.</p>
<p>Down in the cellar there stood a large barrel,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2162src" href="#xd26e2162" name="xd26e2162src">10</a> which had
grown dirty and mouldy from neglect, and wanted scalding out.
&lsquo;Get into the barrel, Maria girl,&rsquo; she bid her next morning
for her task, &lsquo;and scrape it and rub it well before we scald
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maria did as she was bid, and the stepmother went away to boil the
water.</p>
<p>Meantime, the prince&rsquo;s men had taken Maria&rsquo;s slipper to
him, and he, delighted to have any token of his fair one, appointed an
officer to go into every house, and proclaim that the maiden whom the
slipper might fit should be his bride. The officer went round from
house to house, trying the slipper on everybody&rsquo;s foot. But it
fitted no one, for it was under a spell.</p>
<p>But the stepmother&rsquo;s own daughter<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2171src" href="#xd26e2171" name="xd26e2171src">11</a> had gone
down to the cellar to help Maria, unbeknown to her mother; and it so
happened that, just as she was inside the barrel and Maria outside, the
king&rsquo;s officer happened to come by that way. He opened the
door,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2174src" href="#xd26e2174" name=
"xd26e2174src">12</a> and, seeing a damsel standing within, tried on
the sandal without waiting to ask leave. As the sandal fitted Maria to
perfection, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>officer was all impatience to carry her off to the
prince, and placed her in the carriage which was waiting outside, and
drove off with her before anyone had even observed his entrance.</p>
<p>Scarcely had all this passed than the stepmother came back, with her
servants, each carrying a can of boiling water. They placed themselves
in a ring round the barrel, and each emptied her charge into it. As it
was the stepmother&rsquo;s daughter who was inside at the time, instead
of Maria, it was she who got scalded to death in her place.</p>
<p>By-and-by, when the house was quiet, the bad stepmother went to the
barrel, intending to take out the body of Maria and hide it. What was
her dismay when she found, instead of Maria&rsquo;s body, that of her
own daughter! As soon as her distress and grief subsided sufficiently
to enable her to consider what she had to do, the idea suggested itself
to conceal the murder by putting the blame of it on some one else. For
this purpose she took the body of her daughter, and, dressing it in dry
clothes, seated it on the top of the stairs against her husband&rsquo;s
return.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2189src" href="#xd26e2189" name=
"xd26e2189src">13</a></p>
<p>Presently, home he came with his ass-load of wood, and called to her
daughter to come and help him unload it, as usual. But the daughter
continued sitting on the top of the stairs, and moved not. Again and
again he called, louder and louder, but still she moved not; till at
last, irritated beyond all endurance, he hurled one of his logs of wood
at her, which brought the badly-balanced corpse rolling and tumbling
all the way down the stairs, just as the stepmother had designed.</p>
<p>The husband, however, was far from being deceived by the device. He
could see the body presented no appearance of dying from a recent
fall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Maria?&rsquo; he asked, as soon as he got up
into the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody knows; she has disappeared!&rsquo; replied the
stepmother; nor was he slow to convince himself she was nowhere in the
house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;This is no place for me to stay in,&rsquo; said the husband
to himself. &lsquo;One child driven away, and one murdered; who can say
what may happen next?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next morning, therefore, he called to him the little daughter born
to him since his marriage with Maria&rsquo;s stepmother, and went away
with her for good and all. So that bad woman was deprived, as she
deserved, of her husband and all her children in one day.</p>
<p>Just as the father and his daughter were starting to go away, Maria
drove by in a gilded coach with the prince her husband; so he had the
satisfaction, and her stepmother the vexation, of seeing her triumph.

<p class="editorial">I have another Stepmother story, the place of
which is here, but it is too long to give in its entirety. It begins
like the last, and the next, and many others, with a widower, the
teacher of whose children, a boy and girl, insists on marrying him.
Soon after, of course, she turns the children out of doors; the boy is
made the slave of a witch, and comes well at last out of many
adventures; it is one of the nearest approaches to a heroic story that
I have met with in Rome. There are details in it, however, like
Filagranata and others, not actually of the Stepmother group. The girl
gets taken into a Brigand&rsquo;s cave, and goes through adventures
which befall the youngest of <i>three</i> sisters (without a
stepmother) in the Italian-Tirolese tale of &lsquo;Le tre
Sorelle,&rsquo; and that, again, is precisely like another Roman story
I have, in many respects different from the present one, called
&lsquo;The Three Windows.&rsquo; One of the adventures in the present
story is, that the witch, instead of killing the girl, gives her the
appearance of death, and she is shut up in a box instead of being
regularly buried, and a prince, as he goes by hunting, finds her, and
the means of restoring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39"
name="pb39">39</a>]</span>her, and marries her. This is a very common
incident in another group, and occurs in the &lsquo;Siddhi
K&uuml;r&rsquo; story which I have given as &lsquo;The Prayer making
suddenly Rich,&rsquo; in &lsquo;Sagas from the Far East;&rsquo; and in
the third version of &lsquo;Maria de Legno,<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2221" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span> <i>infra</i>, where
also the girl is not even seemingly dead. I cannot forbear subjoining a
quaint version of the story of Joseph, which was told me, embodying the
same incident, though the story of Joseph has usually been identified
with the group in which a younger brother is the hero; by Dr. Dasent,
among others, who gives several examples, under the name of
&lsquo;Boots.&rsquo; In the Roman series this group is represented by

To have <span class="corr" id="xd26e2176" title="Source: un">an</span>

been taken to be a sufficiently distinctive attribute to supply the

l&rsquo;Ebreo?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not by that name. Tell it me, and I&rsquo;ll tell you if
I&rsquo;ve heard it before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was once a <i lang="it">moglie e marito</i> who had
seven sons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, do you mean the Machabees?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. I don&rsquo;t think they were called Machabees&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know. But the youngest of the seven was called Joseph, and
he was his father&rsquo;s Benjamin, and that made the others jealous of
him. They used to go out in the Campagna together to feed the flocks,
for in those days all were shepherds; and when the others had Joseph
out there all alone they said, &ldquo;Let us kill him;&rdquo; and they
were going to kill him; but one said, &ldquo;No, we must not kill him:
we will put him down a well;&rdquo; and so they did.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The next day it happened that a great king went by hunting,
and as his dogs passed the well where Joseph was they scented human
blood and made a great barking, and the king said, &ldquo;See what the
dogs have found.&rdquo; So they took the stone from the mouth of the
well and let a cord down, and behold a beautiful boy came up&mdash;for
Joseph was a beautiful boy&mdash;and he pleased the king, and he took
him home and kept him as a precious jewel, he was so fair. So handsome
was he, that the Queen fell in love with him; and when he
wouldn&rsquo;t listen to her she accused him of having insulted her,
and had him put into prison.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After that the King had a strange dream: he saw three lean
cows and three fat cows; and he saw the three lean cows eat up the
three fat cows; and he sent for all the <i>theologians</i> in the
country, and none of them could tell what the dream meant; but Joseph
said, &ldquo;I can tell what the dream means.&rdquo;&hellip; The rest
as in the Bible.&rsquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They say there was a well-to-do peasant whose wife
died leaving him two children&mdash;a boy and a girl. Both were
beautiful children, but the girl was of the most inconceivable
beauty.</p>
<p>As both were still young, and the father did not know how to supply
a mother&rsquo;s place to them, he sent them to a woman, who was to
teach them and train them, and do all that a mother would have done for
them. So to her they went every day. The woman, however, was bent on
marrying their father, and used to send a message every day to ask why
he did not marry her. The father sent in answer that he did not want to
marry; but the woman continued to repeat the same message so frequently
that, wearied by her importunity, he sent an answer to the effect that
when a pair of strong woollen stockings, which he also gave the
children to take to her, were rotted away he would marry her, and not
before. The woman took the pair of stockings and hung them up in a loft
and damped them with water twice a day till they were soon quite
rotted; then she showed them to the children, and told them to tell
their father what they had seen. When the children went home they said,
&lsquo;Papa! we saw your pair of stockings to-day; they are all rotted
away.&rsquo; But the father said, &lsquo;Nonsense! Those thick
stockings could not have rotted in this time; there must be some unfair
play.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next morning he gave them a large pitcher of water, and told
them to take it to their teacher, saying that when all the water had
dried up he would marry her, and not before. The teacher took the
children up every day to see how rapidly the water diminished in the
jug; but the fact was she used to go first and pour out a little every
day.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2266src" href="#xd26e2266" name=
"xd26e2266src">2</a> At last she showed them the pitcher empty, and bid
them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>tell their father that they had seen it so.
&lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo; said their father; but when they assured him
they had seen the water in it gradually diminish day by day, he saw
there was no way of disputing the fact, and that he was bound by the
condition he himself had fixed.</p>
<p>Accordingly he married the teacher. No sooner, however, was she in
possession of the house than she told the father she would not have the
children about the place; they were not her children, and she could not
bear the sight of them. The father expostulated, saying he had no place
to send them to, but the stepmother continued so persistently in her
representations that, for the sake of peace, he ceased to oppose her,
and she took upon herself the task of disposing of them.</p>
<p>One day, therefore, she made them a large cake,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2275src" href="#xd26e2275" name="xd26e2275src">3</a> and
putting it in a basket with a bottle of wine, she took them for a walk
outside the gates. When they had gone a long, long way, she proposed
that they should sit down and lunch off their cake and wine. The
children were nothing loth; but, while they were eating, the stepmother
slipped away unperceived, and left them alone, thinking that they would
be lost. But the fact was the boy had overheard their father and mother
talking about getting rid of them, and he had provided himself with a
paper parcel<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2278src" href="#xd26e2278"
name="xd26e2278src">4</a> of ashes, and had strewn them all along the
road they had come, unperceived by his stepmother, and so now by this
track they found their way home again.</p>
<p>The stepmother was furious at seeing them come back, but she said
nothing in order not to rouse their suspicions. A few days after,
however, she made another cake and proposed to take them another walk.
The children accompanied her willingly; but the little boy provided
himself with a parcel of millet, and strewed the grain on the ground as
they walked along. They were in no haste, therefore, to finish their
refection. But, alas! when they came to trace the track by which they
were to return, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>there was no means of finding it, for the birds
had come meanwhile and eaten up all the grain. The little girl was
appalled when she saw they were lost, and sat down to cry; but the
little boy said, &lsquo;Never mind; our stepmother was very cross and
unkind to us; perhaps we shall meet with some one who will behave
better to us. Come, let us look for shelter before night comes
on.&rsquo; The little girl took courage at her brother&rsquo;s words,
and, joining hands, they walked on together.</p>
<p>Before night they came to a little cottage, the only one in sight;
so they knocked at the door. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; said a
voice within, and when they answered &lsquo;Friends,&rsquo; an old man
opened the door. &lsquo;Will you please take us in and give us shelter
for the night, for our stepmother has turned us out of our home?&rsquo;
said the little boy. &lsquo;Come in, and welcome,&rsquo; answered the
old man, &lsquo;and you shall be my children.&rsquo; So they went in
and lived with him as his children.</p>
<p>When they had been living there some time, it happened that one day
when the old man and her brother were both out, the king came by
hunting, and he came to the hut and asked for some water to drink. The
extraordinary beauty of the maiden astonished the king, and he asked
her whence she was, and so learnt all her story. When he went home he
told his mother, saying, &lsquo;When I was out to-day I saw the most
beautiful maiden that ever was created. You must come and see
her.&rsquo; The queen-mother did not like going to the poor hut, but
the prince urged her so much that at last she consented to accompany
him. The king drove out beforehand to the cottage and gave notice that
he would like to dine there, and, giving the maiden plenty of money,
told her to prepare the best dinner that ever she could for him and the
queen-mother. The maiden tidied up the cottage so neatly, and prepared
the dinner so well, and did the honours of it so gracefully, that the
queen-mother was won to admire her as much as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>her son
had been, and when the king told her of his intention to make the girl
his wife she was well pleased. So Albina (such was her name) was
married to the king, and her brother was made viceroy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the stepmother had begun to wonder what had become
of the children. But she was a witch, and had a divining rod;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2293src" href="#xd26e2293" name="xd26e2293src">5</a>
this rod she struck, and asked it where the children were. The answer
came, &lsquo;The girl is married to the king, and the lad is made
viceroy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When she heard this she went to her husband and said, &lsquo;Do you
know a sort of remorse has taken me that we let those poor children go
we know not whither. I am resolved to put on a pilgrim&rsquo;s dress
and go and seek them that I may bring them home to us again.&rsquo; The
father was very glad to hear her speak thus, and gave his consent to
her taking the journey. The next day, therefore, she put on a
pilgrim&rsquo;s dress and went forth.</p>
<p>On, on, on she went till she came to the city where Albina was
married to the king. Here she took up her stand opposite the palace
windows, and with her divining rod she called up a golden hen with
golden chickens,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2301src" href="#xd26e2301"
name="xd26e2301src">6</a> and made them strut about under the palace
window. When Queen Albina looked out and saw the wonderful brood, she
sent down at once to call the pilgrim-woman to her and offered to buy
them of her. &lsquo;My hen and chickens I neither sell nor
pledge,&rsquo; answered the pretended pilgrim; &lsquo;I only part with
them at one price.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is the price, good pilgrim, say?&rsquo; answered the
queen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My price is that the queen herself take me down to the palace
garden and show me the whale which I know there is in the
fish-pond.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2308src" href="#xd26e2308"
name="xd26e2308src">7</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;That is a condition easily accepted,&rsquo; answered Albina.
&lsquo;I will take you there at once, good woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The queen and the pretended pilgrim then went down <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>together
to the pond. The pretended pilgrim no sooner came in sight of the whale
than she touched the water with her rod and bade the whale swallow the
queen. The whale obeyed the stroke of the wand imparted through the
water, and the stepmother went up and threw herself on the
queen&rsquo;s bed. When she had well wrapped herself in the coverlets
so as to be hidden, she called the maids to her and bid them tell the
king that the queen was sick. The king immediately came in all haste to
assure himself of the state of the queen. &lsquo;I am ill indeed, very
ill!&rsquo; cried the pretended queen, groaning between whiles;
&lsquo;and there is no hope for me, for there is only one remedy for my
malady, and that I cannot take.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me the one remedy at least,&rsquo; said the king.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The one only remedy for me is the blood of the viceroy, and
that I could not take.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a dreadful remedy indeed,&rsquo; said the king;
&lsquo;but if it is the only thing to save your life, I must make you
take it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no! I could not take it!&rsquo; exclaimed the pretended
queen, for the sake of appearing genuine.</p>
<p>But the king, bent on saving her life at any price, sent and had the
viceroy taken possession of and secured, ready to be slain,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2327src" href="#xd26e2327" name="xd26e2327src">8</a>
in one of the lower chambers of the palace. The windows of this chamber
looked out upon the fish-pond.</p>
<p>The viceroy looked out of the window on to the fishpond, and
immediately there came a voice up to him, speaking out of the whale,
and saying, &lsquo;Save me, my brother, for here am I imprisoned in the
whale, and behold two children are born to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But her brother could only answer, &lsquo;I can give help to none,
for I also am in peril of death, being bound and shut up ready to be
slain!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then a voice of lamentation came up from within the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>whale
saying, &lsquo;Woe is me that my brother is to be slain, and I and my
children are shut up in this horrible place! Woe is me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Presently, the gardener hearing these lamentations, went to the
king, saying, &lsquo;O, king! come down thyself and hear the voice of
one that waileth, and the voice cometh as from within the
whale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The king went down, and at once recognised the voice of the queen;
then he commanded that the whale should be ripped open; no sooner was
this done than the queen and her two children were brought to light.
The king embraced them all, and said, &lsquo;Who then is she that is in
the queen&rsquo;s bed?&rsquo; and he commanded that she should be
brought before him. When the queen had seen her she said, &lsquo;This
is my stepmother;&rsquo; and when the pilgrim&rsquo;s weeds, which she
had taken off, were also found, and it was shown that it was she who
had worked all this mischief, the king pronounced that she was a witch,
and she was put to death, and the viceroy was set at liberty.</p>

every thing that money could buy them, so that one day when the father
was going to a distant mart where he expected to find the choicest
wares, and asked them what he should bring home, they scarcely knew
what to ask. But when he told them he expected to find shawls of such
brilliant hues as they had never seen, with gold threads interwoven,
the eldest instantly begged him to bring her one of these; and when he
said he expected to find coverlets of bird plumage vieing with the
rainbow in brilliancy, the second entreated him to bring her one of
these.</p>
<p>The third daughter, however, who was distinguished by stay-at-home
habits, and by her distaste for vanity of every kind, would not have
any of these gay ornaments, though he not only offered her shawls and
coverlets such as her sisters revelled in the idea of possessing, but
precious jewelry, sparkling rubies, and rarest pearls. She would have
none of these, but asked him only to bring her a pot of marjoram, which
she wanted for household uses as none was to be got in the country
where they were living.</p>
<p>The father soon after set out on his travels, and having reached his
destination did not fail, while laying in his rare and precious stock,
to select the choicest specimens to bestow on his two eldest
daughters.</p>
<p>But the homely pot of marjoram quite went out of his head, and he
returned homewards without having so much as thought of it.</p>
<p>He was nearly home when he was accosted on the way by a
strange-looking man one evening, who asked him if he would not buy of
him a pot of marjoram. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;A pot of marjoram!&rsquo; The words brought back his youngest
daughter&rsquo;s request whom he would not have disappointed for all
the world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A pot of marjoram, say you? Yes, it&rsquo;s just what I want.
Give it here, and there&rsquo;s something extra because it is just what
I want;&rsquo; and throwing him money to three or four times the
ordinary value of the article, he called to an attendant to stow the
pot on to the pack-saddle of one of the mules.</p>
<p>But the stranger held back the pot and laughed in his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had thought you were a trader,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and
knew enough of the rules of trade to let a man fix his own price on his
own wares.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The merchant laughed in his turn at what seemed to him an insolent
comparison.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When a trader goes thousands of miles, through a thousand
perils to bring home precious wares from afar which those at home
scarcely know the use of, true, then, he alone can fix the price. But a
pot of marjoram, every one knows the price of that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not,&rsquo; replied the stranger, binding his cloak
about him with the pot tightly held under his arm. &lsquo;At all events
it is clear <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t;&rsquo; and he took a step forward
as if he considered the negotiation at an end.</p>
<p>The merchant was vexed; he would not on any account miss taking back
a pot of marjoram, and he knew he was now so near home that no other
chance would there be of procuring one. Swallowing down his annoyance
as well as he could, therefore, he led his horse nearer to the strange
man and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You make me quite curious to hear your price named, friend,
as till this moment I had not thought there could be two ideas on the
subject.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My price is three hundred thousand scudi,&rsquo; replied the
strange man, who was really a magician; &lsquo;and if you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>knew its
powers you would know, too, it is cheap at that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And again he made as if he would have gone on his way, indifferent
whether the bargain were concluded or not.</p>
<p>The merchant was quite puzzled how to act. The pot of marjoram he
must have, and his knowledge of the art of bargaining convinced him
that the man&rsquo;s manner meant he would not rebate an iota of his
price. Whatever awkwardness he felt in suddenly giving three hundred
thousand scudi for an article he had just appraised at a paul it was
even more apparent to him that any attempt at haggling would only have
added to the absurdity of the situation by its futility. Therefore,
assuming a magnificent air, as if the vast price were after all no
matter to him, he called to his steward to count out the sum demanded
and rode on.</p>
<p>Arrived at home, his showy presents were received with raptures by
his two eldest daughters, while the youngest received her
modest-seeming share of his generosity with an expression of surprise
and admiration, which gave the good merchant a secret satisfaction in
imagining that she was not altogether ignorant of its immense
value.</p>
<p>As days went by, however, everything fell back into the usual
routine. The elder sisters continued the same round of gaiety in which
they had ever been immersed, the younger remained as of old, quietly
absorbed in her household duties; but if she had any pastime it was
that of diligently cultivating her pot of marjoram. By degrees,
however, through the steward&rsquo;s gossip with the servants, it came
round to the knowledge of the sisters that, though their younger sister
had seemed to frame so humble a request, its satisfaction had cost
their father&rsquo;s treasury a fabulous sum. The discovery excited
their utmost indignation, and their jealousy being roused, they
determined to inflict a condign and appropriate punishment for what
they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>deemed her presumption, by destroying the
illstarred pot of marjoram.</p>
<p>To get at it, however, was no easy matter, as its guardian seldom
left the house, and was always watching over it with jealous care. At
last they resolved, by way of pretext for securing her absence, to
represent to their father that it was not good for a young girl to
remain so shut up; that whether she had a taste for it or not, she
ought to see the world; and urged their arguments so efficaciously that
he quite admitted their cogency, and one evening, calling his youngest
daughter to him, imperatively required that she should accompany him to
an evening engagement.</p>
<p>The poor child dared not disobey her father, but parted from her pot
of marjoram with a heavy heart, as if some foreboding of evil possessed
her. No sooner had she left the house than the sisters went up into her
room, and taking the pot of marjoram, flung it out of the window, so
that it all lay broken and shattered on the highroad, where it was soon
trampled under foot and every vestige of it dispersed.</p>
<p>When she came in and saw what was done her grief was unbounded, and
no sooner was the house sunk in slumber than, determining to live no
longer under the same roof with those who had treated her so
unfeelingly, she set out to wander forth absorbed in sorrow, and not
caring whither she went.</p>
<p>On, on, on she went, taking no heed of the way, all through the
night, and when the morning dawned she found herself in the midst of a
vast plain, at a place where many roads met. As she hesitated for a
moment which she should take, there suddenly appeared before her a
fairy,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2412src" href="#xd26e2412" name=
"xd26e2412src">2</a> though the last time she looked up she had not
seen a speck anywhere between herself and the horizon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are you going so early, my pretty maiden, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>why weep you?&rsquo; said the fairy, in a soothing
voice that seemed made to charm an answer out of the most
reluctant.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was no easy question to answer, for the maiden had
no sort of idea whither she was going; therefore she took the second
question first and poured out the whole tale of her sisters&rsquo;
harshness and her late terrible disappointment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not so very bad after all,&rsquo; replied the fairy,
when she had finished her tale. &lsquo;I see you have been trying to be
a sensible girl, but you must be brave as well as sensible. Men say of
us women, &ldquo;Women always look at the dark side of
things;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2423src" href="#xd26e2423"
name="xd26e2423src">3</a> there is always a bright side which you must
try to look out for, even when, as in this instance, you couldn&rsquo;t
possibly see it; for all the evil that befalls us does not work evil in
the end.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2426src" href="#xd26e2426" name=
"xd26e2426src">4</a> Now it happens that there is a particularly bright
side to this case of yours, and the evil that was done you will bring
you no ultimate harm. But you must exercise fortitude and stedfastness
in what you will have to do. For this I will give you a man&rsquo;s
clothing, as it would not be seemly for a young girl like you to be
going about the world alone, and it will save you from many
dangers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So saying, though she had no bundle of any sort about her, she
produced a complete suit of male attire, travelling cloak and all, and
in the girdle were bound weapons, and many articles of which the maiden
did not even know the use or the name, but the fairy assured her she
would want them all by and by. Then, having pointed out which was the
road she should take, she again bid her be of good heart, and
disappeared almost before the maiden had time to utter her heartfelt
thanks.</p>
<p>The fairy had no sooner vanished than the whole face of the country
wore a different aspect; instead of being surrounded by a vast plain,
mighty mountains rose on the right hand and on the left, while before
her, straight <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>along her path, was a dense forest. The
maiden&rsquo;s heart misgave her at the sight, but she remembered the
fairy&rsquo;s advice and walked steadily along. Notwithstanding her
conversation had not seemed to last many minutes too, the sun was
already high in the heavens, and its rays beat so fiercely upon her
that she was glad even of the gloomy forest&rsquo;s shade. Arrived at
the first trees she was pleased to hear the trickling of a little brook
over the stones, and to find that the good fairy had not failed to give
her a supply of provisions of which she now gladly availed herself.</p>
<p>As the afternoon grew cooler she rose and walked on till nightfall
without further adventure, and then disposed herself to rest for the
night, climbing first into the spreading boughs of a large tree, that
she might be out of the way of any wild beasts which the forest might
harbour.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night her sleep was disturbed by a horrible
growling; and what was her surprise when she fully woke to find that
though it proceeded from a common he-, and she-bear<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2439src" href="#xd26e2439" name="xd26e2439src">5</a> stretched
out under the very tree she had chosen for her resting-place, she could
understand all the meaning it contained just as if they had spoken in
words; and she recognised the new power as another gift of the good
fairy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where have you been all this long time?&rsquo; growled the
she-bear; &lsquo;it is quite abominable what a long time you stay away
now continually; I have been hunting through the whole forest for
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was quite waste of trouble,&rsquo; replied the he-bear
testily, &lsquo;for I have been a long way from the forest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where were you, then?&rsquo; growled the she-bear again, with
a tone that showed she was determined to know all about it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you must know, I went twenty miles along the side of the
river, then over the back of the rocky mountains, and then skirting
round the forest till I came to the kingdom <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>of
Persia. And out of the kingdom of Persia there went up a great wail,
for last night, from his high tower, the king of Persia fell out of
window and broke all his bones, moreover his flesh is all cut with the
glass, which has entered into his wounds. Therefore the land of Persia
bewails her king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then let them get another king,&rsquo; growled the
she-bear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not so easy,&rsquo; rejoined the he-bear. &lsquo;For
over all the face of the earth was no king so comely in person as the
king of Persia. But that is not the worst, for the matter concerns us
more nearly than you have any idea of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can it concern us?&rsquo; retorted the she-bear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It concerns us so much that if anyone only knew of us we
should both be killed. For the only remedy for his wounds is that we
should both be killed, the fat of our bodies be melted together, an
ointment made of it with honey and wax, and be smeared over the
king&rsquo;s body, and then bathe him in warm baths, doing this
alternately for the space of three days he will be made well again. And
now he has sent a proclamation into all lands inviting any physician to
come to heal him by his art, and if any of them by their books and
their divination should discover this we both shall certainly be put to
death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense! do come and go to sleep,&rsquo; replied the
she-bear testily; &lsquo;how should anyone find us out in the midst of
this forest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not very likely certainly,&rsquo; growled the
he-bear.</p>
<p>And in consequence of this happy feeling of security both brutes
were soon fast asleep.</p>
<p>How gladly the maiden listened to their snoring, when she found she
could understand it just as well as their growling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sound asleep,&rsquo; snored the she-bear.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m so tired I don&rsquo;t want ever to wake
again,&rsquo; snored her mate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither shall you,&rsquo; said the maiden as she noiselessly
let herself down from the tree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only think of that old king of Persia wanting our fat; long
may he wish for it!&rsquo; snored the she-bear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now it would be a fine thing to give back all his strength
and his beauty to the king of Persia, but the price of one&rsquo;s life
is too much for the honour,&rsquo; snored the he-bear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nevertheless, you shall have that honour,&rsquo; whispered
the maiden, as she drew two sharp two-edged knives with which her
girdle was furnished, and, taking her stand firmly, plunged one with
each hand deep into the throat of each beast. A mingled stream of blood
gushed forth, and the two huge carcases rolled over without so much as
a grunt, so neatly had the execution been performed.</p>
<p>By the first morning&rsquo;s light she once more called all her
courage to her assistance, and cut up the carcasses, extracting the
fat. Then she lit a fire and melted it down together, nor was she
without the requisite wax and honey, for the good fairy had provided
her with enough of each. The ointment made, she set out to follow the
line of travel the bear had indicated, and not without much toil and
weariness at last found herself in the kingdom of Persia. Strong in
belief in the efficacy of her remedy, she presented herself at once at
the palace gate and demanded admission on the score of her ability to
effect the desired cure of the ailing king.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Though I may not have the high-sounding fame of which I
daresay many can boast who have come at the summons of your king, yet
so certain am I of the powers of my treatment that I put my life in
your hands, and give you leave to torture me to death if I succeed
not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fear not, fair sir,&rsquo; replied the chamberlain; &lsquo;no
difficulty will be made in admitting you, for you alone have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>applied to heal the king. Every other mediciner
throughout the whole world, on reading the description of the
king&rsquo;s ailments given in the proclamation, has pronounced his
health past recovery, and not one will even make the
attempt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pale, emaciated, and agonised as he was, the maiden at once
recognised on her admission to the presence of the king the justice of
the bear&rsquo;s account of his personal attractions, and now more
earnestly than ever desired her success.</p>
<p>The king very willingly submitted to her medicaments, and at the end
of three days was, as the bear had predicted, quite sound in limb and
restored to all his beauty of person. If his personal attractions had
been an object of admiration to the maiden, those of his supposed
physician had not been lost on the king, and when she came on the
fourth day to take her leave of him, he told her at once he could not
think of parting with her; she must remain attached to his court, and
be always his physician in attendance. The flush of joy which she could
not conceal at the proposal sufficed to convince the king of the
justice of certain suspicions he had already entertained, that his
supposed physician was no physician, but a maiden worthy to be his
queen.</p>
<p>For the moment he said nothing further, but only assigned to the
stranger apartments in the palace, and a suite of his own, and a yearly
stipend on the most liberal scale. As days went by, being continually
in each other&rsquo;s presence, with that familiarity which their new
relations allowed, each had the opportunity of growing more and more
fond of the other. At last the king called his chamberlain to him one
day and told him it was his desire that the state physician should
appear before him dressed in queenly robes, and attended by a train of
ladies of the court, and damsels and pages of honour.</p>
<p>The chamberlain fancied that the life-peril through <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>which
the prince had so lately passed had injured his brain, and only
undertook the commission with a visible reluctance. Nevertheless, as he
durst not disobey any command of his sovereign, how strange soever, all
was done as he had directed; though what puzzled the chamberlain the
more was that the physician seemed as nearly demented as the king, for,
instead of testifying any reluctance in submitting to such a travesty,
his countenance had betrayed the most unmistakable joy at hearing the
king&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>
<p>The king had further given orders for the attendance of all the
great officers of state and all the nobles of the land, as well as his
guards of various degrees, all in brilliant gala dress. Before going
into the state hall to receive their homage, however, he entered alone
into his private cabinet, whither he commanded the attendance of his
physician. Both meeting thus, each habited to the greatest advantage in
their own appropriate dress, each was more than ever smitten with the
attractions of the other. The king was not very long in winning from
the maiden the confession that the robes she now wore were those of her
sex, or that she shared his own desire that they should be united by
that tie which would bind them together inseparably for ever. No sooner
had he thus obtained her consent than he led her into the midst of the
assembled court and required the homage of all his people to her as
their queen.</p>
<p>As for the wicked sisters, his first act was to send for them and
have them burnt to death. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They say there was once a rich merchant who had three
daughters. Two of them were very gay and fond of dancing and theatres,
but the youngest was very stay-at-home and scarcely ever went beyond
the garden.</p>
<p>One day when the father was going abroad to buy merchandise, he
asked his three daughters what he should bring them home. The two
eldest asked for all manner of dresses and ornaments, but the youngest
asked only for a pot of rue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a funny fancy,&rsquo; said the father,
&lsquo;but an easy one to satisfy at all events; so be sure you shall
have it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so easy, perhaps, as you think,&rsquo; replied the
maiden; &lsquo;only now you have promised it, mind you bring it, as you
will find you will not be able to get home unless you bring it with
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The father did not pay much heed to her words, but went to a far
country, bought his merchandise, taking care to include the fine
clothes and jewels for his two eldest daughters, and, forgetting about
the pot of rue, set out to come home.</p>
<p>They were scarcely a day&rsquo;s journey out at sea when the ship
stood quite still, nor was the captain able by any means to govern it,
for neither sail nor oar would move it an inch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some one on board has an unfulfilled promise on him,&rsquo;
declared the captain; and he called upon whoever it was to come forward
and own it, that he might be thrown overboard, and that the lives of
all the passengers and crew should not be put in jeopardy by his
fault.</p>
<p>Then the merchant came forward and said it was true he had forgotten
to bring with him something he had promised to his little daughter, but
that it was so slight a matter he did not think it could be that which
was stopping the ship. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58"
name="pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>As no one else had anything of the sort to accuse themselves of, the
captain judged that it was indeed the merchant&rsquo;s fault that had
stopped the ship; only, as he was such a great merchant and a frequent
trader by his vessel, he agreed to put back with him instead of
throwing him overboard. He first, however, asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what may the thing be that you have to take to your
daughter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing but a pot of rue,&rsquo; replied the merchant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A pot of rue!&rsquo; answered the captain; &lsquo;that is no
easy matter. In the whole country there is no one has a plant of it but
the king, and he is so choice over it that he has decreed that if
anyone venture to ask him only for a single leaf he shall instantly be
put to death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is bad hearing,&rsquo; said the merchant.
&lsquo;Nevertheless, as I have promised to get it I must make the
trial, and if I perish in the attempt I might have had a worse
death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they landed the merchant, and he went straight up to the
king&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Majesty!&rsquo; he said, throwing himself on his knees before
the throne. &lsquo;It is in no spirit of wantonness I break the decree
which forbids the asking a single leaf of the precious plant of rue. A
promise was on me before I knew the king&rsquo;s decree, and I am bound
thereby to ask not merely a single leaf but the whole plant, of the
king, even though it be at peril of my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then said the king,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To whom hadst thou made this promise?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the merchant made answer,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Though it was only to my youngest daughter I made the
promise, yet having made it, I will not leave off from asking for
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the king answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because thou hast been faithful to thy promise, and
courageous in risking thy life rather than to break thy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>word,
behold I give the whole plant at thy desire; and this without breaking
my royal decree. For my decree said that whoso desired a single leaf
should be put to death, but in that thou hast asked the whole plant
thou hast shown a courage worthy of reward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he took the plant of rue and gave it to the merchant to give to
his daughter; moreover, he bade him tell her that she should every
night burn a leaf of the plant. With that he dismissed him.</p>
<p>The merchant returned home and distributed the presents he had
brought to his daughters, and not more pleased were the elder ones with
their fine gifts than was the younger with her simple pot of rue. In
the evening they went with their father to the ball as usual, but the
youngest staid at home as she was wont to do, and this night she burnt
a leaf of the rue as the king had bidden her. But the king had three
beautiful sons, and no sooner had she burnt the rue leaf than the
eldest son of the king appeared before her, and sitting beside her,
said so many kind things that no evening had ever passed so pleasantly.
This she did every evening as the king had bidden.</p>
<p>But the other merchants said to the merchant her father,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is it that only two daughters come to the
balls?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the merchant, not knowing how to account for the youngest
daughter&rsquo;s preference for staying at home, answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have only two daughters old enough to come to the
balls?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the other merchants said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, but bring now thy youngest daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the next evening the merchant made the youngest daughter go with
him to the ball, and the two elder daughters were left at home.</p>
<p>As the youngest was wont never to leave her room, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>others,
how jealous soever they were of her, were never able to do her any
harm. But now that they felt secure she was absent for a considerable
space, they went into her apartment and set fire to it, and the whole
place was burnt, and also the garden, and the plant of rue.</p>
<p>If the king&rsquo;s son had come in haste for the burning of a
single leaf, I leave it to be imagined with what speed he came for the
burning of the whole plant. With such impetus, indeed, he came, that he
was bruised and burnt all over with the flaming beams of which the
apartment was built, and cut all over with the broken glass; so that
when he reached home again he was in a sorry plight indeed.</p>
<p>But the youngest daughter, coming home with her father from the
ball, and finding all her apartment burnt to the ground, as well as all
the plants in the garden, and with them the pot of rue, she said,
&lsquo;I will stay no more in this place.&rsquo; So she dressed herself
in man&rsquo;s clothes and wandered forth.</p>
<p>On, on, on, she went, till night came, and she could go no further,
but she laid herself to sleep under a tree. In the middle of the night
came an ogre and an ogress,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2664src" href=
"#xd26e2664" name="xd26e2664src">2</a> and laid themselves down also
under the tree. Then she heard the ogre speaking to the ogress, and
saying, &lsquo;Our king&rsquo;s eldest son, the flower of the land, is
sore ill and like to die, having fallen through the window of the
highest story of the palace, and is cut with the glass, and bruised all
over. What shall be done to heal the king&rsquo;s eldest son, the
flower of the land?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the ogress made answer: &lsquo;This is what should be
done&mdash;but it is well no one knows it. They should kill us, and
take the fat that is round our hearts and make an ointment, and anoint
therewith the wounds of the king&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the merchant&rsquo;s daughter heard this, she waited till the
ogre and ogress were gone to sleep; then she took <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>out a
brace of pistols&mdash;for with the man&rsquo;s dress she had also a
brace of pistols&mdash;and with one in each hand she killed the ogre
and ogress together, and with her knife she ripped them open, and took
out the fat that was round their hearts. Then she journeyed on till she
came to the king&rsquo;s palace. At the door of the palace stood a
guard, who told her there was no entrance for such as her; but she
said, &lsquo;To heal the wounds of the king&rsquo;s eldest son am I
come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the sentinel laughed, and said, &lsquo;So many great and
learned surgeons have come, and have benefited him nothing, there is no
entrance for a mountebank like thee. Begone! begone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But she, knowing certainly that she had the only means of healing,
would not be sent away; and when the sentinel would have driven her off
she struggled so bravely that he had to call out all the guard to
resist her; and when they all used their strength against her, she
protested so loudly that the noise of the struggle made the king
himself begin to inquire what was the matter. Then they told him,
&lsquo;Behold, there stands without a low and base fellow, who would
fain pretend to heal the wounds of the king&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the king answered: &lsquo;As all the great and learned surgeons
have failed, let even the travelling doctor try his skill; maybe he
knows some means of healing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then she was brought into the apartment of the king&rsquo;s son, and
she asked for all she needed to make the ointment, and linen for
bandages, and to be left alone with him for the space of a week. At the
end of a week the king&rsquo;s son was perfectly cured and well. Then
she dressed herself with care, but still in the garb of a travelling
doctor&mdash;for she had no other&mdash;and stood before him, and said,
&lsquo;Know you me not?&rsquo; And when he looked at her he said,
&lsquo;Ah! yes; the maiden of the rue plant!&rsquo; For till then she
had been so soiled with the dust of travel that he could not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>recognise her. Then when he had recognised her he
protested he would marry her, and, sending to the king his father, he
told him the same.</p>
<p>When the king heard of his resolve, he said, &lsquo;It is well that
the prince is healed of his wounds; but with the return of bodily
health it is evident he has lost his reason, in that he is determined
to marry his surgeon. Nevertheless, as nothing is gained in this kind
of malady by contradiction, it is best to humour him. We must get this
surgeon to submit to be dressed up like a princess, and we must amuse
him by letting him go through the form of marrying her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was done, therefore, as the king had said. But when the ladies of
the court came to attend the supposed surgeon, and saw her dressed in
her bridal robes, they saw by the way they became her that she was
indeed a woman and no surgeon, and that the prince was by no means
distempered in his mind.</p>
<p>But the prince silenced their exclamations, saying: &lsquo;Nay, but
say nothing; for perchance if my father knew that this should be a real
marriage, and no mere make-believe to humour a disordered whim, he
might withhold his consent, seeing the maiden is no princess. But I
know she is the wife destined for me, because my mother, before she
died, told me I should know her by the pot of rue; and because, by
devoting herself to healing me, she has deserved well of me. So let the
marriage go through, even as the king my father had devised.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the marriage was celebrated, and when the king learnt afterwards
that the pretended surgeon was a real maiden, he knew the thing could
not be altered, and said nothing. So the merchant&rsquo;s daughter
became the prince&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p class="first">In this case the merchant, when he goes out to buy his
wares, asks his three daughters what he shall bring them. The eldest
asks for fine dresses, the second for beautiful shawls, the third for
nothing but some sand out of the garden of King Otho. The king had
registered sentence of death against anyone who should ask for the
sand. But in consideration of a bribe of three hundred scudi the
gardener gives him a little.</p>
<p>When she gets it, the daughter burns a little in the evening, when
the sisters are gone to a ball. Instantly King Otho comes, and falls in
love with her. She gives him a most exquisite pair of knee-bands she
has embroidered, before he goes away. The second night she gives him a
handkerchief of her work, and the third a beautiful necktie.</p>
<p>After this, her father insists one evening that she should go to the
ball. Her sisters say that if she goes they shall stay away. When she
is gone they burn down her room, and in it all the sand of King
Otho&rsquo;s garden. If the king came quickly for the burning of a
little pinch, he naturally comes in exceeding greater haste at the
burning of the whole quantity: in such haste that he is wounded all
over with the blazing beams and broken glass. There is a great
explosion.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2714src" href="#xd26e2714" name=
"xd26e2714src">2</a> As he knew nothing about the spite of the sisters,
he could only think that the mischief arose from the misconduct of her
to whom the sand had been given, and determines accordingly to have
nothing more to do with her.</p>
<p>When she comes home, and finds what has happened, she is in despair.
She dresses like a man and goes away. In the night, in a cave where she
takes shelter, she hears an ogre and ogress talking over what has
happened, and they say that the only cure is an ointment made of their
blood.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2719src" href="#xd26e2719" name=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=

of reward the supposed doctor will name; but she will have nothing but
some of the sand of the garden. She contrives, however, to discover the
knee-bands, the handkerchief, and the necktie she had given him, and
asks him what they are. &lsquo;Oh, only the presents of a faithless
lover,&rsquo; he replies. She then insists he should give them up to
her, which he does, and she goes away.</p>
<p>When she gets home she burns a pinch of the sand, and the king is
forced by its virtue to appear; but he comes in great indignation, and
accuses her of wounding him. She replies it was not she who wounded
him, but who healed him. He is incredulous; and she shows him the
knee-bands, handkerchief, and necktie, which convince him he owes his
healing to her. They make peace, and are married.</p>
<p class="editorial">[Mr. Ralston gives a very pretty counterpart of so
much of this story as relates to the transformation of a human being
into a flower, at p. 15 of the story commencing at page 10, and
&lsquo;Aschenputtel,&rsquo; Grimm, p. 93, has something like it; but I
do not recall any European story in which a person is actually wounded
and half-killed by damage done to a tree mysteriously connected with
him. There is something like it in the &lsquo;trees of life&rsquo;
which people plant, and their withering is to be a token that harm has
befallen them.</p>
<p class="editorial">Overhearing the advice of supernatural beasts
under a tree occurs in the Norse &lsquo;True and Untrue,&rsquo; and is
very common in all sorts of ways, everywhere. It enters, too, into the
analogous Italian Tirolean tale of &lsquo;I due cavallari,&rsquo; where
witches figure instead of the orco and orchessa. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span></p>
<p class="editorial">Next, are four stories in which many incidents of
the Cinderella type are set in a different framework; they are
represented in the Gaelic by &lsquo;The King who wanted to marry his
Daughter;&rsquo; at the end of which reference will be found to other
versions, where are details occurring in one or other of the following:
that from Straparola is naturally the most like the Roman, but it is
not like any one of them all throughout, and forms a remarkable link
between the first Roman and the two Gaelic versions. The girl&rsquo;s
answer, that she &lsquo;came from the country of candlesticks,&rsquo;
in the second version, is noteworthy, because it connects it with the
Roman story of the &lsquo;Candeliera,&rsquo; at the same time that it
conveys no sense in its own. The box in the Gaelic versions recalls,
just as Mr. Campbell says, the fine old chests which served for
conveying home the <i lang="it">corredo</i> (including much more than
<i lang="fr">trousseau</i> in its modern use) of the bride, which are
not only preserved as heirlooms and curiosities in many an Italian
palace, but in many a museum also; there are some very handsome ones at
Perugia. And yet it is just in the Italian versions that the box loses
this character. In Straparola&rsquo;s, it is a wardrobe; in the two
versions of &lsquo;Maria di Legno,&rsquo; a wooden statue; in &lsquo;La
Candeliera,&rsquo; it has the shape of a candlestick. In the third
version of &lsquo;Maria di Legno,&rsquo; the box used is only an old
press that happens to be in the deserted tower.</p>
<p class="editorial">Mr. Ralston, pp. 77&ndash;8, supplies a Russian
counterpart, in which it is a prince, and not a maiden, who is conveyed
in a provisioned box, and this is linked hereby with the Hungarian
story of Iron Ladislas, who descends by such means to the underground
world in search of his sisters; and this again connects this story both
with those in which I have already had occasion to mention him and with
one to follow called &lsquo;<span lang="it">Il R&egrave;

href="#xd26e2758" name="xd26e2758src">1</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once again my story is of a widower father; this time,
however, a king, and having one only daughter, Maria, the apple of his
eye and the pride of his heart. The one concern of his life was to
marry her well and happily before he died.</p>
<p>The queen, whom he believed to be wise above mortal women, had left
him when she died a ring, with the advice to listen to the addresses of
no one on Maria&rsquo;s behalf but his whose finger a gold ring which
she gave him should fit, for that he whom it alone should fit would be
a noble and a worthy husband indeed.</p>
<p>Maria&rsquo;s teacher was very different from those we have had to
do with hitherto; she was a beneficent fairy, whose services her good
and clever mother had obtained for her under this disguise, and all her
lessons and actions were directed entirely for her benefit, and she was
able to advise and look out for her better than her father himself.</p>
<p>Time went by, and no one who came to court Maria had a finger which
the ring would fit. It was not that Maria was not quite young enough to
wait, but her father was growing old and feeble, and full of ailments,
and he hasted to see her settled in life before death called him
away.</p>
<p>At last there came to sue for Maria&rsquo;s hand a most accomplished
cavalier, who declared himself to be a prince of a distant region, and
he certainly brought costly presents, and was attended by a brilliant
retinue well calculated to sustain the alleged character.</p>
<p>The father, who had had so much trouble about fitting the ring, was
much disposed not to attend any more to this circumstance when the
prince objected to be subjected to so trivial a trial. After some days,
however, as he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>hesitated finally to make up his mind to bestow
her on him without his having fulfilled this condition, he suddenly
consented to submit to it, when, lo and behold, the ring could not be
found!</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you have not got the ring,&rsquo; said the prince,
&lsquo;it really is not my fault if it is not tried on. You see I am
perfectly willing to accept the test, but if you cannot apply it you
must not visit it on me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What you say is most reasonable,&rsquo; said the father.
&lsquo;But what can I do? I promised her mother I would not let the
girl marry anyone but him the ring fitted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean then that the girl is never to marry at all,
since you have lost the ring! That would be monstrous indeed. You may
be sure, however, in my case, the ring <i>would</i> have fitted if you
had had it here, because I am so exactly the kind of husband your wife
promised the ring <i>should</i> fit. So what more reasonable than to
give her to me? However, to meet your wishes and prejudices to the
utmost, I am willing to submit to any other test, however difficult,
the young lady herself likes to name. Nay, I will say&mdash;three
tests. Will that satisfy you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>All this was so perfectly reasonable that the father felt he could
not but agree to it, and Maria was told to be ready the next day to
name the first of the tests which she would substitute for that of the
ring.</p>
<p>Though the prince was so handsome, so accomplished, so rich, and so
persevering with his suit, Maria felt an instinctive dislike to him,
which embarrassed her the more that she had no fault of any sort to
find with him which she could make patent to her father.</p>
<p>To the compassionate and appreciative bosom of her teacher she
poured out all her grief, and found there a ready response.</p>
<p>The teacher, who by her fairy powers knew what mortals could not
know, knew that the prince was no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"
href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>other than the devil,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2797src" href="#xd26e2797" name="xd26e2797src">2</a>
and that the marriage must be prevented at any price, but that it would
be vain for her to give this information to the father, as he would
have laughed in her face, and told her to go and rule copy-books and
knit stockings. She must, therefore, set to work in a different way to
protect her charge from the impending evil.</p>
<p>In the first instance, however, and without mentioning the alarming
disclosure of who her suitor really was, she merely bid Maria to be of
good courage and all would come right; and for the test she had to
propose, she bid her ask him to produce a dress woven of the stars of
heaven.</p>
<p>The next morning, accordingly, when the prince came to inquire what
her good pleasure was, she asked him to bring her a dress woven of the
stars of heaven.</p>
<p>The prince bit his lip, and a look of fierceness it had never worn
before stole over his face at hearing this request. And though he
instantly put on a smile, there was much suppressed anger perceptible
in the tone with which he answered,</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is not your own idea. Some one who has no good will
towards me has told you this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was no part of the condition, I think, that I should act
without advice, and certainly no part of it that I should say whether I
took advice or not,&rsquo; replied Maria discreetly; and then her
desire to break from the engagement making her bold, she added,
&lsquo;But, you know, if you do not like the test, or consider it in
any way unfair, I do not press you to accept it. You will meet with no
reproach from me if you renounce it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear no! I have no such wish,&rsquo; the prince hastened
to reply. &lsquo;The dress woven of the stars of heaven will be here by
to-morrow morning, and you have only to be ready by the same time to
name what is the second test you propose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maria hastened back to her teacher to recount the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>story of
the morning&rsquo;s work; to tell of the moment of hope she had had
that the prince would renounce the attempt, and then his final
acceptance of the undertaking. &lsquo;Dear teacher mine! Cannot you
think of something else so very, very difficult I can give him to do
to-morrow that he may be obliged to refuse it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-morrow I would have you ask him for a dress woven of
moonbeams,&rsquo; replied the teacher; &lsquo;which will be very
difficult to supply; but I fear he will yet find the means of
accomplishing it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next morning the dress woven of the stars of heaven was brought
in by six pages, and it was all they could do to carry it, for the
dazzling of the rays of the stars in their eyes. When the dress of
moonbeams was asked for, the prince showed little less impatience than
at the first request, but yet undertook to supply it, and reminded
Maria that the next day she must be ready with her third test.</p>
<p>Once more Maria had recourse to her sage teacher&rsquo;s counsels,
and this time was advised to ask for a dress woven of sunbeams.</p>
<p>The next day the dress woven of moonbeams was produced, but it
required twelve pages to bring it in, for it was so dazzling they could
only hold it for ten minutes at a stretch, and they had to carry it in
relays, six at a time. When Maria now asked for the dress woven of
sunbeams, the prince grew so angry that she was quite frightened, and
at the same time entertained for a moment a confident hope that now, at
last, he would own himself baffled. Nevertheless, at the end of a few
moments&rsquo; hesitation, he pronounced his intention of complying,
but added in almost a threatening tone, &lsquo;And remember that when
it comes to-morrow morning you will not then have any more ridiculous
tests to prefer, but will belong to me for ever, and must be prepared
to go away with me in the carriage that will be at the door.&rsquo; He
turned on his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>heel as he spoke and stalked away, without saying
good-bye, or so much as turning to look at her, or he would have seen
she had sunk down on the ground in an agony of despair.</p>
<p>Her father came in and found her thus, and asked her what could
possibly put her into such a state on the eve of such a brilliant
marriage. Maria threw herself in his arms and told him all her
distress, but when it was told it sounded childish and
unreasonable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can anything be more absurd?&rsquo; replied the old man.
&lsquo;To-morrow I may be dead, and what will become of you? What can
you desire more than a husband suited to you in age and person, with
every advantage the world can offer? And you would throw all this away
for the sake of a foolish fancy you cannot even explain! Dry your tears
and do not listen to such fancies any more, and keep your pretty little
face in good order for looking as smiling and as pleasing as such a
devoted husband deserves you should look on your wedding morning. It is
I who have to lament; I who shall be left alone in my old age; but I do
not repine, I shall be quite happy for my few remaining days in knowing
that you have all the happiness life can afford you;&rsquo; and as he
spoke he clasped her fondly in his arms.</p>
<p>Maria, reassured by his words, began to think he was in the right,
and she was thus as cheerful as he could wish that last night they were
to spend together.</p>
<p>But when night came and she found the teacher who understood her so
well, waiting to put her to bed for the last time, all her own true
feelings came back, and, bursting into tears, she entreated her to find
some way of delivering her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The time has come,&rsquo; replied the teacher, &lsquo;that I
should tell you all. The innocence and truthfulness of your heart
guided you right in believing that the prince was no husband for you.
You did not, and could not, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href=
"#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>know who he was; but now I must tell
you he is the devil himself. Nay; do not shudder and tremble so; it
remains entirely with yourself to decide whether you shall be his or
not; he can have no sort of power over any against their
will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, of course, I will have nothing to do with him,&rsquo;
replied the child, simply. &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell papa, and
make him send him away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because, for one thing, he would not believe me. As I have
said, the prince being what he is can have no power over you against
your own will. Your breaking from him must be your own act. Further,
you must understand the terms of the struggle. Power is given him to
deceive, and thus he has deceived your father. I have been set by your
mother to watch over you, and I can tell you what he is, but I have no
power to undeceive your father. If I were to attempt it it would do no
good, he would not believe me, and it would break his heart to see you
renounce so promising an union. On the other hand, you must understand
that when the devil wooes a maiden in this form he does not suddenly
after appear with horns and hoofs and carry her off to brimstone and
fire. For the term of your life he will behave with average kindness
and affection, and he will abundantly supply you with the good things
of this world. After that I need not say what the effect of his power
over you will be. On the other hand, if you give him up you must be
prepared to undergo many trials and privations. It is not merely going
on with your present life such as it has been up till now. Those
peaceful days are allowed for youthful strength to mature, but now the
time has come that you have to make a life-choice. What do you say?
Have you courage to renounce the ease and enjoyment the prince has to
offer you and face poverty, with the want and the insults which come in
its train?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor little Maria looked very serious. She had never <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>felt any
great attraction for the prince, it is true, but now the question was
placed upon a new issue. She had learnt enough about duty and
sacrifice, and she had always intended to do right at all costs, but
now that the day of trial had come it seemed so different from what she
had expected, she knew not what to say.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are tired to-night, my child; and it is late,&rsquo; said
the teacher. &lsquo;We will say no more till the morning. I will wake
you betimes and you shall tell me your mind then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the morning Maria&rsquo;s mind was made up. She had chosen the
good part; but how was she to be delivered from the prince?</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is what you will have to do,&rsquo; replied the teacher,
after commending her good resolution. &lsquo;I have had made ready for
you a wooden figure of an old woman, inside which I will stow away all
that you have valuable, for it may be of use some day, but especially I
will bestow there the dresses woven of the stars of heaven, of
moonbeams, and that of sunbeams, which, I doubt not, the prince will
bring you, according to promise, in the morning. When you have driven
with him in his carriage all day, towards evening you will find
yourself in a thick wood. Say to him you are tired with sitting in the
carriage all day, and ask to be allowed to walk a little way in the
wood before sundown. I, meantime, will place ready my wooden figure of
an old woman, which you will find there, and, watching for a moment
when he has his head turned, place yourself inside the figure and walk
away. There is another thing which you must do, which is very
important. When the ring was lost, you must know it was he who took it,
and, though he kept it studiously concealed all the while he was in
your father&rsquo;s palace, he will now carry it boldly slung on the
feather in his cap; this you must find means of possessing yourself of
during the journey, because it is essential to you that you should have
it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>in your own hands. And fear nothing either, in
making your escape, for the ring is your own property, which he has
falsely taken; and, in leaving him, remember he can have no power over
you against your will. I may not inform you what may befall you in your
new character as poor Maria Wood, but be good and courageous; always,
as now, choose the right bravely in all questions and doubts, and you
shall not go unrewarded.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was little time for leave-taking between the good teacher and
her affectionate pupil, for the prince almost immediately after came to
claim his bride, and all the neighbours and friends came, too, to the
festivities. The dress woven of sunbeams was brought by four-and-twenty
pages, for it was so dazzling they could not hold it for more than five
minutes at a time, and they had to carry it by relays.</p>
<p>At last leave-takings and festivities were over, and, amid the
good-wishes and blessings of all, Maria drove away in the
prince&rsquo;s carriage. On they drove all day, and towards the end of
it, as it was getting dark, Maria contrived to twitch the ring from the
prince&rsquo;s cap without his being aware of it; presently after she
exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh dear! how cramped I feel from sitting all day in
this carriage; cannot I walk a little way in this wood before it gets
dark?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most certainly you can, if you wish,&rsquo; replied the
prince, who, having everything his own way, was in a very accommodating
humour.</p>
<p>When they had walked a little way down the forest-path, Maria espied
the wooden form she was to assume, placed ready under a tree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That old woman will have a longish way to go to get a
night&rsquo;s shelter, I fancy,&rsquo; exclaimed the prince, with a
laugh which made Maria shudder, both from its heartlessness and also
because it reminded her that she would soon find herself alone, far
from shelter, in that dark wood. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74"
href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>But was it not better to be
alone in the dark than in such company as that she was about to leave,
she said to herself. Then she turned once more to look at it. The
figure looked so natural she could not forbear saying mechanically,
&lsquo;Poor old woman! give me a little coin to bestow on her that she
may wish us Godspeed on our night-journey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; replied the prince. &lsquo;Never let me hear
you talk such idle stuff. And, come, it is time to go back into the
carriage; it is getting quite dark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! what a beautiful firefly!&rsquo; exclaimed Maria,
reminded by the speech to hasten her separation from her uncongenial
companion, &lsquo;Oh, do catch it for me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prince lifted his cap, and ran a few steps after the insect.
&lsquo;Oh, I see another, and I shall catch it before you catch
yours&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see!&rsquo; So saying, she darted towards the
tree where the wooden figure stood ready, and placing herself inside,
walked slowly and freely along, counterfeiting the gait of an aged and
weary woman.</p>
<p>The prince had soon caught the firefly and was bringing it back in
triumph, when, to his dismay, Maria was nowhere to be seen. He ran this
way and that, called and shouted in vain. The servants with the
carriage were too far off to have seen anything; there was no witness
to appeal to but the old woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which way did the young lady run who was walking with me just
now?&rsquo; he eagerly inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Down that path there to the right, as fast as the firefly
itself could fly, and if she comes back as quickly as she went she will
be back presently,&rsquo; replied Maria Wood, feigning the voice of an
old woman.</p>
<p>The prince ran in the direction indicated, and was soon himself lost
in the mazes of the forest, where he wandered hopelessly all night; and
only when the morning light came was he able to make his way back to
his carriage, and drive home ashamed and crestfallen, giving up
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>his conquest in despair, and vowing useless
vengeance against the fairy godmother, whose intervention he now
recognised it was had baffled him.</p>
<p>Maria meantime walked steadily and fearlessly along, guided by the
stars which peeped here and there through the tall trees. Nor was
shelter so far off as the prince had said. Before very long a party of
charcoal-burners hailed her, and offered a share of such poor
hospitality as they could command. It was very different from the
comforts of her father&rsquo;s house; but Maria took it as the first
instalment of the hardships she had accepted.</p>
<p>Maria&rsquo;s wooden form was very skilfully made; the limbs had
supple joints, which could be moved by the person inside just like
those of a living being; and the clothes the teacher had provided being
just like those of the country people about, no one entertained the
least suspicion that Maria Wood, as she had now become, was anything
different from themselves.</p>
<p>The charcoal-burners were kind, simple people, and, finding Maria
willing to assist them in their labours to the extent of her powers,
proposed to her to stay and cast in her lot with them as long as the
season for their work lasted; and she did their hard work and shared
their poor fare with never a word of complaint.</p>
<p>At last, one day, when she was on I know not what errand, at some
distance from the encampment, the young king of the country, who had
lately been called to the throne, came through the forest hunting, with
a large retinue of followers. Crash, crash, like thunder, went the
brushwood as the wild boar trampled it down, and the eager dogs bounded
after him with lightning speed. They passed close to Maria, who was as
much alarmed as if she had really been the old woman she seemed to be:
but when she saw the riders bearing down upon her, their horses&rsquo;
hoofs tearing up the soil, and the branches everywhere <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>giving
way before their impetuosity, her heart failed her entirely, and she
swooned away upon the grass. The king, however, was the only one whose
course passed over the spot where she was, and he only perceived her in
time to rein up his mount just before it might have trampled on
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See here to this old body, whom we have nearly frightened to
death,&rsquo; he cried; and the huntsmen came and lifted her up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some of you carry her home to the palace, that she may be
attended to,&rsquo; said the king further; and they carried her home to
the palace, and laid her on a bed, and restored her senses.</p>
<p>When the king came home from the hunt, he would go himself to see
how it had fared with her; and when he found her almost restored he
asked her whither she would wish to be sent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Little it matters to me where I go,&rsquo; replied Maria
Wood, in the saddened voice of grief-stricken age; &lsquo;for home and
kindred have I none. Little it matters where I lay my weary bones to
rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the king heard her speak thus he compassionated her, and
inquired if there was any service in the household that could be
offered her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please your Majesty, there is not much strength in her for
work,&rsquo; replied the steward; &lsquo;but, if such is your royal
will, she can be set to help the scullions in the kitchen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will that suit you, old dame?&rsquo; inquired the king.
&lsquo;They shall not ask too much of you, and a good table and warm
shelter shall never be wanting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All thanks to your Majesty&rsquo;s bounty. My heart could
desire nothing more than to live thus under the shadow of your
Majesty,&rsquo; replied Maria, making a humble obeisance.</p>
<p>And thus Maria, from a princess, became a servant of servants.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use of giving us such a cranky old piece as
that for a help?&rsquo; said the scullion to the turnspit, as Maria was
introduced to her new quarters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, as to that, as she has taken the service she must do it,
cranky or not cranky,&rsquo; answered the turnspit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye, I dare say we shall be able to get it out of her one way
or another,&rsquo; replied the scullion.</p>
<p>And they <i>did</i> get it out of her; and Maria had more put upon
her, and less of kind words and scarcely better food than with the
charcoal-burners. But she took it all in silence and patience, and no
complaint passed her lips. She had no fixed duties, but one called her
here and another there; she was at everyone&rsquo;s bidding, but she
did her best to content them all.</p>
<p>Then came the Carneval; and on the last three days every servant had
license to don a domino and dance at the king&rsquo;s ball. What an
opportunity for Maria Wood! After serving in her unbecoming disguise
with so much endurance and perseverance for now a full year, here was
one day on which she might wear a becoming dress, and enjoy herself
according to the measure of her age and sex, and due position in the
world.</p>
<p>All the household, all royal as it was, was in a hubbub of
confusion. No one was at work&mdash;no one at his post; and there was
no one to notice that Maria Wood was absent, like the rest.</p>
<p>Locking herself into the loft which served her for a sleeping-place,
Maria not only came out of her wooden disguise, but took out of it the
garment woven of the stars of heaven&mdash;a most convenient dress for
the occasion. At a masqued ball no one can recognise anybody else,
except by a guess suggested by familiar characteristics which the
domino fails to disguise. But no one at the king&rsquo;s court was
familiar with the characteristics of Maria Wood; and wherever she
passed the whole company was in an excitement to know whose was the
elegant figure shrouded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href=
"#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>in such a marvellous costume. But
there was so much majesty in her air, that no one durst ask her to
dance or so much as approach her.</p>
<p>Only the king himself felt conscious of the right to offer to lead
her to the dance; and she, who had not forgotten how handsome he was,
and how kind he had been on the night that his huntsmen had nearly
frightened her to death in the forest, right willingly accepted the
favour. But even he was so awed by her grace and dignity, that, charmed
as he was with her conversation, and burning to know her style and
title, he yet could not frame the question that would ascertain whence
she had come.</p>
<p>Very early in the evening, while the other masquers reckoned the
amusement was only beginning, Maria, with characteristic moderation,
chose an opportunity for withdrawing unperceived from the ballroom.</p>
<p>It will readily be imagined that the next night every one was full
of curiosity, and the king most of all, to know whether the lady in the
starry dress would appear again; and the more that, though everybody
had been talking of her to the exclusion of everyone else the whole
intervening day through, no one could offer a satisfactory conjecture
as to who she could possibly be.</p>
<p>While all eyes were full of expectation, accordingly, the second
evening, suddenly and unannounced there appeared in their midst a form,
graceful and mobile like hers they had so much admired, but draped in a
still more dazzling dress (for Maria this night wore her garment woven
of moonbeams); and it was only the king who had the certainty that it
was really the same person.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you take away all the light of our ball so early last
night?&rsquo; inquired the king, as they were dancing together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have to be up early, and so I must go to bed early,&rsquo;
replied Maria.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what can a sylph-like creature like you have to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>get up early in the morning for? You are only fit
to lie on a bed of roses, with nightingales to sing to you,&rsquo;
pursued the king.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My occupations are very different, I can assure your
Majesty,&rsquo; said Maria, with a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can those occupations possibly be?&rsquo; inquired the
king eagerly; &lsquo;I am dying to know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, fie! You must not ask a domino such a direct question as
that; it is as bad as asking her name, and that is against all rules.
But see, the dancers await your Majesty; we are putting them all
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus she put him off, and she fenced so well that he succeeded no
better in searching out the mystery in all his subsequent attempts.
Though he had determined, too, never to leave her side all the evening,
that he might certainly observe which way she went, she was so alert
that she defeated his plans. Kings have a certain etiquette to observe,
even at a Carneval ball; and while social exigencies demanded that he
should bestow a salute on one and another of the distinguished
personages present, Maria contrived to gather her shining raiment round
her so as to invert its dazzling folds, and glide away unperceived.</p>
<p>The king was beside himself with vexation when he found she was
gone; nor could he sleep all the succeeding night, or rather those
hours which must be stolen out of the day to make a night of when the
real night has been spent in revels. One thought occupied him, which
was that the succeeding night was the last in which he could expect to
have the chance of obtaining an explanation from his fair partner of
the dance. The next day began the gloom of Lent, and she would
disappear from his sight forever. He arranged in his head a dozen forms
of conversation by which to entrap her into some admission by which he
could find out who she could possibly be; he determined to be more
vigilant than ever in observing her movements; and, to provide against
every possible chance of failure, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>stationed guards at every
exit of the ballroom, with strict orders to follow her when she
passed.</p>
<p>In the midst of the ball on the third night Maria entered more
radiant than ever, having on her dress woven of sunbeams. The masquers
put their hands up to shade their eyes as she passed, and the
chandeliers and torches were paled by its brilliance. The king was at
her side immediately, but though he put in requisition all the devices
he had prepared, Maria succeeded in evading them all, and the evening
passed away without his being a bit wiser about how to see more of her
than he had been at the beginning. The only thing that gave him a
little hope that she did not mean absolutely to abandon him, was that
in the course of the evening she took out a ring, which she told him
had never fitted anyone yet, and begged him, as a matter of curiosity,
to try it on his hand; and then when it strangely happened that it
fitted him perfectly, she could not altogether conceal the pleasure it
seemed to give her. Nevertheless, she put up the ring again, and would
give no further explanation about it any more than about herself.</p>
<p>By-and-by, choosing her moment as dexterously as before, she made
her escape without exciting the king&rsquo;s attention. The guards,
however, were all expectation, and notwithstanding that she had taken
the precaution of turning the sunbeams inwards, they recognised her,
and followed softly after her as they had been bidden. Maria, however,
did not fail to perceive they were following her, and, to divert their
attention, took off a string of precious pearls she wore round her
throat, and, unthreading them on the ground, escaped swiftly to her
loft while the guards were occupied in gathering up the treasure.</p>
<p>The king was disconsolate beyond measure when he found that all his
schemes were foiled, and that his radiant maiden had passed away like
the rays in which she was clothed, leaving only darkness and weariness
for him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>So disconsolate he grew that nothing could
distract him. He would no more occupy himself with the affairs of the
state, still less with any minor occupations. He could not bear the
light of the sun because its beams reminded him of his loss, and he
dreaded similarly the sight of the moon or the stars, but, shut up in a
dark room almost hopeless, he wept the weary days away.</p>
<p>So remarkable a change in the habits of the young king became the
subject of general comment, and could not fail to reach the ears of
even so insignificant a menial as Maria. She, indeed, had every reason
to hear of it, for scarcely could the afflicted king be induced to take
the simplest food, and the attendants of the kitchen were reduced to
complete inactivity. Maria was no longer called hither and thither at
everyone&rsquo;s pleasure, and as long as this inactivity lasted she
knew the king was still of the same mind about herself. But at last the
talk of the kitchen took a more alarming character; it was reported
that physicians had been called in, and had pronounced that unless
means were found to distract him his state of despondency would prove
fatal, but that nothing which had been tried had the least effect in
rousing him from his melancholy.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Meantime Lent was passing away and Easter was close at hand. Maria
thought she might now be satisfied with his constancy, and determined
to take the step which she had good reason to believe would restore all
his vigour.</p>
<p>Accordingly, while the cooks and scullions were all dispersed about
one thing and another, she went into the kitchen and made a cake, into
which she put the ring, and took it up herself to the queen-mother. It
was not very easy for such a haggard old woman to obtain admission to
the private apartments, but when she declared she had come about a
remedy for the king, she was made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82"
href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>welcome. Having thus obtained
the ear of the queen-mother, she assured her, with many protestations,
that if the king could he made to eat the whole of the cake, without
giving the least piece of it to anyone, he would be immediately cured.
But that if he gave away the least piece the virtue might be lost. This
was lest he should thus give away the ring to anyone. The ladies
waiting on the queen laughed at the old woman&rsquo;s pretensions, and
would have driven her away with contumely, but the queen said:
&lsquo;Nay, who knows but there may be healing in it. Experience often
teaches the old remedies which science has failed to
discover.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then she dismissed Maria with a present, and took the cake in to the
king, trying to amuse him with the old woman&rsquo;s story; but the
king refused to be amused, and let the cake be. Only as he took no
notice of what food he ate, and they gave him this cake for all his
meals, he took it as he would have taken anything else that had been
set before him. When he cut it, his knife struck against something
hard, and when he had pulled this out, he found it was the very ring
his sylphlike partner had given him the night she wore the dress woven
of sunbeams.</p>
<p>At the sight he started like one waking from a trance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How came this ring here?&rsquo; he exclaimed; and the
queen-mother, who had stood by to see the effect of the remedy,
replied,</p>
<p>&lsquo;A certain old woman, whom you befriended in the forest and
told the servants to shelter in the palace, brought me the cake, saying
it would prove a remedy for your melancholy, which she had prepared out
of gratitude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let her be called instantly hither,&rsquo; then said the
king; and they went to fetch Maria Wood; but Maria could nowhere be
found.</p>
<p>The king was at this announcement very nearly relapsing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>into his
former condition; but the idea came to his mind to find something out
by means of the ring itself. Therefore he summoned together all the
goldsmiths, and refiners, and alchemists of his kingdom, and bid them
tell him the history of the ring.</p>
<p>At the end of seven days&rsquo; trial the oldest of the alchemists
brought it back to the king and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;We find, O King, that this ring is made of gold which comes
from afar. Moreover, that the workmanship is such as is only produced
in the kingdoms of the West, and the characters on it pronounce that
its owner is a princess of high degree, whose dominions exceed greatly
those of the King&rsquo;s Majesty in magnitude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The king now ordered a more urgent search to be made for Maria Wood,
as the only clue by which to reach the fair owner of the ring; and
Maria, having heard by report of the alchemists&rsquo; announcement,
thought it was time to let herself be known. Habiting herself,
therefore, in becoming attire, with jewels befitting her rank, with all
of which the fairy had amply provided her, she entered for the last
time her wooden covering, and went up to the king in answer to his
summons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come hither, good woman,&rsquo; said the king encouragingly;
&lsquo;you have indeed done me good service in sending me this ring,
and have repaid a hundredfold the little favour I bestowed on you in
taking you into the palace. If, now, you will further bring me hither
her to whom this ring belongs, or take me where I may find her, you
shall not only live in the palace, but shall live there in royal state
and luxury, and whatsoever more you may desire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At these words Maria stepped out of her wooden case, and stood
before the king in all her youthful beauty, telling him all her
story.</p>
<p>The proofs that supported it were sufficient to silence every doubt;
and when the people were called together to celebrate her marriage with
the king, the whole nation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href=
"#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>hailed her accession as their queen
with the greatest delight.</p>
<p>Soon after, the royal pair went to visit Maria&rsquo;s father, who
had the joy of knowing that his child was really well established in
life. They stayed with him till he died; and then his dominions were
added to those of the king, Maria&rsquo;s husband. Maria did not forget
to inquire for her good mistress, but she had long ago gone back to
Fairyland.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><i>SECOND VERSION.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another version of this, differing in many details,
was given me in the following form. The former was from Loreto; this,
from Rome itself.</p>
<p>They say, there was a king, whose wife, when she came to die, said
to him,</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I am dead, you will want to marry again; but take my
advice: marry no woman but her whose foot my shoe fits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But this she said because the shoe was under a spell, and would fit
no one whom he could marry.</p>
<p>The king, however, caused the shoe to be tried on all manner of
women; and when the answer always was that it would fit none of them,
he grew quite bewildered and strange in his mind.</p>
<p>After some years had passed, his young daughter, having grown up to
girl&rsquo;s estate, came to him one day, saying,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, papa; only think! Mamma&rsquo;s shoe just fits
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does it!&rsquo; replied the simple king; &lsquo;then I must
marry you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that cannot be, papa,&rsquo; said the girl, and ran
away.</p>
<p>But the simple king was so possessed with the idea that he must
marry the woman whom his wife&rsquo;s shoe fitted, that he sent for her
every day and said the same thing. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85"
href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>But the queen had not said that
he should marry the woman whom her shoe fitted, but that he should not
marry any whom it did not fit.</p>
<p>When the princess found that he persevered in his silly caprice, she
said at last,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa, if I am to do what you say, you must do something for
me first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Agreed, my child,&rsquo; replied the king; &lsquo;you have
only to speak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, before I marry,&rsquo; said the girl, &lsquo;I want a
lot of things, but I will begin with one at a time. First, I want a
dress of the colour of a beautiful noontide sky, but all covered with
stars, like the sky at midnight, and furnished with a parure to suit
it.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3049src" href="#xd26e3049" name=
"xd26e3049src">3</a></p>
<p>Such a dress the king had made and brought to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next,&rsquo; said the princess, &lsquo;I want a dress of the
colour of the sea, all covered with golden fishes, with a fitting
parure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such a dress the king had made, and brought to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next,&rsquo; said the princess, &lsquo;I want a dress of a
dark blue, all covered with gold embroidery and spangled with silver
bells, and with a parure to match.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such a dress the king had made and brought to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are all very good,&rsquo; said the princess; &lsquo;but
now you must send for the most cunning artificer in your whole kingdom,
and let him make me a figure of an old woman<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3064src" href="#xd26e3064" name="xd26e3064src">4</a> just like
life, fitted with all sorts of springs to make it move and walk when
one gets inside it, just like a real woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such a figure the king had made, and brought it to the princess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is just the sort of figure I wanted,&rsquo; said she;
&lsquo;and now I don&rsquo;t want anything more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the simple king went away quite happy.</p>
<p>As soon as she was alone, however, the princess packed all the three
dresses and many of her other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=
"#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>dresses, and all her jewellery and a
large sum of money, inside the figure of the old woman, and then she
got into it and walked away. No one seeing an old woman walking out of
the palace thought she had anything to do with the princess, and thus
she got far away without anyone thinking of stopping her.</p>
<p>On, on, on, she wandered till she came to the palace of a great
king, and just at the time that the king&rsquo;s son was coming in from
hunting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you a place in all this fine palace to take in a poor
old body?&rsquo; whined the princess inside the figure of the old
woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no! get out of the way! How dare you come in the way of
the prince!&rsquo; said the servants, and drove her away.</p>
<p>But the prince took compassion on her, and called her to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s your name, good woman?&rsquo; said the
prince.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maria Wood is my name, your Highness,&rsquo; replied the
princess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what can you do, since you ask for a place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I can do many things. First, I understand all about
poultry, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rsquo; replied the prince; &lsquo;take her,
and let her be the henwife,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3097src" href=
"#xd26e3097" name="xd26e3097src">5</a> and let her have food and
lodging, and all she wants.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they gave her a little hut on the borders of the forest, and set
her to tend the poultry.</p>
<p>But the prince as he went out hunting often passed by her hut, and
when she saw him pass she never failed to come out and salute him, and
now and then he would stop his horse and spend a few moments in gossip
with her.</p>
<p>Before long it was Carneval time; and as the prince came by Maria
Wood came out and wished him a &lsquo;good Carneval.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3106src" href="#xd26e3106" name="xd26e3106src">6</a>
The prince stopped his horse and said, his young head full of the
pleasure he expected, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87"
name="pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;To-morrow, you know, we have the first day of the
feast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure I know it; and how I should like to be there:
won&rsquo;t you take me?&rsquo; answered Maria Wood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shameless old woman,&rsquo; replied the prince, &lsquo;to
think of your wanting to go to a <i>festino</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3118src" href="#xd26e3118" name="xd26e3118src">7</a> at your time
of life!&rsquo; and he gave her a cut with his whip.</p>
<p>The next day Maria put on her dress of the colour of the noontide
sky, covered with stars like the sky at midnight, with the parure made
to wear with it, and came to the feast. Every lady made place before
her dazzling appearance, and the prince alone dared to ask her to
dance. With her he danced all the evening, and fairly fell in love with
her,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3123src" href="#xd26e3123" name=
"xd26e3123src">8</a> nor could he leave her side; and as they sat
together, he took the ring off his own finger and put it on to her
hand. She appeared equally satisfied with his attentions, and seemed to
desire no other partner. Only when he tried to gather from her whence
she was, she would only say she came from the country of
Whipblow,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3126src" href="#xd26e3126" name=
"xd26e3126src">9</a> which set the prince wondering very much, as he
had never heard of such a country. At the end of the ball, the prince
sent his attendants to watch her that he might learn where she lived,
but she disappeared so swiftly it was impossible for them to tell what
had become of her.</p>
<p>When the prince came by Maria Wood&rsquo;s hut next day, she did not
fail to wish him again a &lsquo;good Carneval.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-morrow we have the second <i>festino</i>, you know,&rsquo;
said the prince.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well I know it,&rsquo; replied Maria Wood;
&lsquo;shouldn&rsquo;t I like to go! Won&rsquo;t you take
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You contemptible old woman to talk in that way!&rsquo;
exclaimed the prince. &lsquo;You ought to know better!&rsquo; and he
struck her with his boot.</p>
<p>Next night Maria put on her dress of the colour of the sea, covered
all over with gold fishes, and the parure <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>made to wear with it, and
went to the feast. The prince recognised her at once, and claimed her
for his partner all the evening, nor did she seem to wish for any
other, only when he tried to learn from her whence she was, she would
only say she came from the country of Bootkick.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3145src" href="#xd26e3145" name="xd26e3145src">10</a> The prince
could not remember ever to have heard of the Bootkick country, and
thought she meant to laugh at him; however, he ordered his attendants
to make more haste this night in following her; but what diligence
soever they used she was too swift for them.</p>
<p>The next time the prince came by Maria Wood&rsquo;s hut, she did not
fail to wish him again a &lsquo;good Carneval.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-morrow we have the last festino!&rsquo; exclaimed he, with
a touch of sadness, for he remembered it was the last of the happy
evenings that he could feel sure of seeing his fair unknown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you must take me. But, what&rsquo;ll you say if I come to
it in spite of you?&rsquo; answered Maria Wood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You incorrigible old woman!&rsquo; exclaimed the prince;
&lsquo;you provoke me so with your nonsense, I really cannot keep my
hand off you;&rsquo; and he gave her a slap.</p>
<p>The next night Maria Wood put on her dress of a dark blue, all
covered with gold embroidery and spangled with silver bells, and the
parure made to wear with it. The prince constituted her his partner for
the evening as before, nor did she seem to wish for any other, only
when he wanted to learn from her whence she was, all she would say was
that she came from Slapland.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3158src" href=
"#xd26e3158" name="xd26e3158src">11</a> This night the prince told his
servants to make more haste in following her, or he would discharge
them all. But they answered, &lsquo;It is useless to attempt the thing,
as no mortal can equal her in swiftness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this, the prince fell ill of his disappointment, because he
saw no hope of hearing any more of the fair domino with whom he had
spent three happy evenings, nor could any doctor find any remedy for
his sickness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Maria Wood sent him word, saying, &lsquo;Though the
prince&rsquo;s physicians cannot help him, yet let him but take a cup
of broth of my making, and he will immediately be healed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense! how can a cup of broth, or how can any medicament,
help me!&rsquo; exclaimed the prince. &lsquo;There is no cure for my
ailment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again Maria Wood sent the same message; but the prince said
angrily,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell the silly old thing to hold her tongue; she
doesn&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s talking about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But again, the third time, Maria Wood sent to him, saying,
&lsquo;Let the prince but take a cup of broth of my making, and he will
immediately be healed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time the prince was so weary that he did not take the
trouble to refuse. The servants finding him so depressed began to fear
that he was sinking, and they called to Maria Wood to make her broth,
because, though they had little faith in her promise, they knew not
what else to try. So Maria Wood made ready the cup of broth she had
promised, and they put it down beside the prince.</p>
<p>Presently the whole palace was roused; the prince had started up in
bed, and was shouting,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bring hither Maria Wood! Quick! Bring hither Maria
Wood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they ran and fetched Maria Wood, wondering what could have
happened to bring about so great a change in the prince. But the truth
was, that Maria had put into the cup of broth the ring the prince had
put on her finger the first night of the feast, and when he began to
take the broth he found the ring with the spoon. When he saw the ring,
he knew at once that Maria Wood could tell where to find his fair
partner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait a bit! there&rsquo;s plenty of time!&rsquo; said Maria,
when the servant came to fetch her in all haste; and she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>waited
to put on her dress of the colour of the noontide sky.</p>
<p>The prince was beside himself for joy when he saw her, and would
have the betrothal celebrated that very day.</p>

<p class="first">In another version, on the princess refusing to do
what the king wishes, he sends his servants to take her to a high tower
he has out in the Campagna, and bids them carry her to the top and drop
her down.</p>
<p>They take her there; but have not the heart to throw her down. In a
corner of the upper story of the tower they see a large case or
press.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose we shut her up in this great press, and leave her in
the middle of the open Campagna, a long way off, to the providence of
God? It will be better than killing her,&rsquo; says one of them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have nothing against the plan,&rsquo; answered the others;
&lsquo;provided we take her so far that she cannot possibly come back
to our king&rsquo;s country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they locked her up in the great box, and carried the box a long,
long way out in the open Campagna, and left it there to the providence
of God.</p>
<p>The poor princess was very glad to have escaped death; but she felt
very desolate in the box. As she was wondering what would happen to
her, she was suddenly frightened by a great barking of dogs round the
box. A king&rsquo;s son had come by hunting, and his dogs had smelt
human blood in the box.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Call the dogs off, and let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s in the
box,&rsquo; said the prince.</p>
<p>So they opened the box; and when they saw the princess inside, they
saw she was no common maiden, for she had a stomacher and earrings of
brilliants. So they brought her to the prince, and she pleased him, and
he married her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They say there was once a king who wanted to make his
beautiful young daughter marry an old, ugly king. Every time the king
talked to his daughter about this marriage, she cried and begged him to
spare her; but he only went on urging her the more, till at last she
feared he would command her to consent, so that she might not disobey;
therefore at last she said: &lsquo;Before I marry this ugly old king to
please you, you must do something to please me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, anything you like I will do,&rsquo; replied he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you must order for me,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;a
splendid <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>candelabrum, ten feet high, having a thick stem
bigger than a man, and covered all over with all kinds of ornaments and
devices in gold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That shall be done,&rsquo; said the king; and he sent for the
chief goldsmith of the court, and told him to make such a candelabrum;
and, as he was very desirous that the marriage should be celebrated
without delay, he urged him to make the candelabrum with all
despatch.</p>
<p>In a very short space of time the goldsmith brought home the
candelabrum, made according to the princess&rsquo;s description, and
the king ordered it to be taken into his daughter&rsquo;s apartment.
The princess expressed herself quite pleased with it, and the king was
satisfied that the marriage would now shortly take place.</p>
<p>Late in the evening, however, the princess called her chamberlain to
her, and said to him: &lsquo;This great awkward candlestick is not the
sort of thing I wanted; it does not please me at all. To-morrow morning
you may take it and sell it, for I cannot bear the sight of it. You may
keep the price it sells for, whatever it is; but you had better take it
away early, before my father gets up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The chamberlain was very pleased to get so great a perquisite, and
got up very early to carry it away. The princess, however, had got up
earlier, and had placed herself inside the candlestick; so that she was
carried out of the palace by the chamberlain, and thus she escaped the
marriage she dreaded so much with the ugly old king.</p>
<p>The chamberlain, judging that the king would be very angry if he
heard of his selling the splendid candelabrum he had just had made, did
not venture to expose it for sale within the borders of his dominions,
but carried it to the capital of the neighbouring sovereign. Here he
set it up in the market-place, and cried, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;ll buy my
candelabrum? Who&rsquo;ll buy my fine candelabrum?&rsquo; When all the
people saw what a costly candelabrum it was, no one would offer for it.
At last it got bruited about till it <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>reached the ears of the
son of the king of that country, that there was a man standing in the
market-place, offering to sell the most splendid candelabrum that ever
was seen; so he went out to look at it himself.</p>
<p>No sooner had the prince seen it than he determined that he must
have it; so he bought it for the price of three hundred scudi, and sent
his servants to take it up into his apartment. After that, he went
about his affairs as usual. In the evening, however, he said to his
body-servant, &lsquo;As I am going to the play to-night, and shall be
home late, take my supper up into my own room.&rsquo; And the servant
did as he told him.</p>
<p>When the prince came home from the play, he was very much surprised
to find his supper eaten and all the dishes and glasses
disarranged.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the meaning of this?&rsquo; he exclaimed, calling his
servant to him in a great fury. &lsquo;Is this the way you prepare
supper for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say, your Royal Highness,&rsquo;
stammered the man; &lsquo;I saw the supper properly laid myself. How it
got into this condition is more than I can say. With the leave of your
Highness, I will order the table to be relaid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the prince was too angry to allow anything of the sort, and he
went supperless to bed.</p>
<p>The next night the same thing happened, and the prince in his
displeasure threatened to discharge his servant. The night after,
however, his curiosity being greatly excited as he thought over the
circumstance, he called his servant, and said: &lsquo;Lay the supper
before I go out, and I will lock the room and take the key in my
pocket, and we will see if anyone gets in then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, though this is what he said outloud, he determined to stay
hidden within the room; and this is what he did. He had not remained
there hidden very long when, lo and behold, the candelabrum, on which
he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>never bestowed a thought since the moment he
bought it, opened, and there walked out the most beautiful princess he
had ever seen, who sat down at the table, and began to sup with hearty
appetite.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Welcome, welcome, fair princess!&rsquo; exclaimed the
astonished prince. &lsquo;You have heard me from within your
hiding-place speaking with indignation because my meal had been
disturbed. How little did I imagine such an honour had been done me as
that it should have served you!&rsquo; And he sat down beside her, and
they finished the meal together. When it was over, the princess went
away into her candelabrum again; and the next night the prince said to
his servant: &lsquo;In case anyone eats my supper while I am out, you
had better bring up a double portion.&rsquo; The next day he had not
his supper only, but all his meals, brought into his apartment; nor did
he ever leave it at all now, so happy was he in the society of the
princess.</p>
<p>Then the king and queen began to question about him, saying:
&lsquo;What has bereft our son of his senses, seeing that now he no
more follows the due occupations of his years, but sits all day apart
in his room?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then they called him to them and said: &lsquo;It is not well that
you should sit thus all day long in your private apartments alone. It
is time that you should bethink yourself of taking a wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the prince answered, &lsquo;No other wife will I have but the
candelabrum.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When his parents heard him say this they said: &lsquo;Now there is
no doubt that he is mad;&rsquo; and they spoke no more about his
marrying.</p>
<p>But one day, the queen-mother coming into his apartment suddenly,
found the door of the candelabrum open, and the princess sitting
talking with the prince. Then she, too, was struck with her beauty, and
said: &lsquo;If this is what you were thinking of when you said you
would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>marry the candelabrum, it was well judged.&rsquo;
And she took the princess by the hand and led her to the presence of
the king. The king, too, praised her beauty, and she was given to the
prince to be his wife.</p>
<p>And the king her father, when he heard of the alliance, he too was
right glad, and said he esteemed it far above that of the ugly old king
he wanted her to have married at the first.</p>
<p class="editorial">[The mode of telling adopted by Roman narrators
makes a way out of the difficulty which this group of stories presents
at first sight in the king seeming to be fated by supernatural
appointment to marry his daughter. One says, &lsquo;the queen did not
say he was to marry her the ring fitted, but he was not to marry any it
did not fit.&rsquo; The other says, the slipper was a supernatural
slipper, and would not fit anyone whom he could marry. Whether this was
a part of the traditional story or the gloss of the repeater, I do not
pretend to decide. In the &lsquo;Candeliera,&rsquo; though similar in
the main, this difficulty does not arise.</p>
<p class="editorial">My Roman narrators seem to have been fonder of
stories of maidens than of youths. I have only one of the latter, and
by no means an uncommon one, to set off against all the Stepmother
stories of the former. It, however, is the male counterpart of a
prolific family in which the girls figure under similar circumstances.
Grimm gives several, particularly &lsquo;Frau Holle,&rsquo; p. 104. Dr.
Dasent gives &lsquo;The two Stepsisters.&rsquo; In the Tales of Italian
Tirol are two, &lsquo;C&ouml;lla d&ouml;ll&ouml; doi sores&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Le due sorelle.&rsquo; And among the Russian Tales,
&lsquo;Frost,&rsquo; p. 214. It has also been connected with the large
group in which a rich brother (sometimes the elder, sometimes the
younger) leaves his poor brother to starve, and ultimately gets
terribly punished for enviously grasping at the poor one&rsquo;s

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a man who had one son, who married a
widow who also had one son, and both were hunchbacks. The wife took
very good care of her own son, but the son of her husband she used to
put to hard work and gave him scarcely anything to eat. Her son, too,
used to imitate his mother, and sadly ill-treat his stepbrother.</p>
<p>After treating him ill for a long time, she at last sent him away
from the house altogether.</p>
<p>The poor little hunchback wandered away without knowing where to
go.</p>
<p>On, on, on he went, till at last he came to a lonely hut on a wide
moor. At his approach a whole host of little hunchbacks came out and
danced round him, chanting plaintively&mdash;</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Sabbato!</p>
<p class="line">Domenica!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">a great number of times. At last our little hunchback
felt his courage stirred, and, taking up the note of their chant,
chimed in with&mdash;</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Luned&igrave;!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Instantly the dancing ceased, all the little hunchback
dwarfs became full-grown, well-formed men, and, what was better still,
his own hump was gone too, and he felt that he, too, was a well-grown
lad.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good people,&rsquo; said our hunchback&mdash;now hunchbacked
no more&mdash;&lsquo;I thank you much for ridding me of my hump and
making me a well-grown lad. Give me now some work to do among you, and
let me live with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the chief of the strange people answered him and said:
&lsquo;This favour we owe to you, not you to us; for it was your
chiming in with the right word on the right note which destroyed the
spell that held us all. And in testimony <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>of our gratitude we give
you further this little wand, and you will not need to work with us. Go
back and live at home, and if ever anyone beats you as heretofore, you
have only to say to it, &ldquo;At &rsquo;em, good
stick!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3310src" href="#xd26e3310"
name="xd26e3310src">2</a> and you will see what it will do for
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then all disappeared, and the boy went home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you&rsquo;ve come back, have you?&rsquo; said the
stepmother. &lsquo;What, and without your hump, too! Where have you
left that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the good boy told her all that had happened, without hiding
anything.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you hear that?&rsquo; said the stepmother to her own son.
&lsquo;Now go you and get rid of your hump in the same way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the second hunchback went forth, and journeyed on till he came to
the lonely hut on the moor.</p>
<p>A tribe of hunchbacks came out and danced round him, and
sung&mdash;</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Sabbato!</p>
<p class="line">Domenica!</p>
<p class="line">Luned&igrave;!</p>

<p class="first">to which the bad son of the stepmother added in his
rough voice, all out of tune&mdash;</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Marted&igrave;!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Immediately all the hunchbacks came round him and gave
him a drubbing, and the chief of them stuck on him a hump in front as
well as behind.</p>
<p>Thus they sent him home to his mother.</p>
<p>When his mother saw him come home in this plight, she turned upon
the stepson and abused him for having misled her son to injure him; and
both mother and son set upon him and belaboured him after their wont.
But he had only told the truth, without intention to deceive; and the
stepmother&rsquo;s son had incurred the anger of the dwarfs by his
discordant addition to their chant. So the first hero took out his wand
and said, &lsquo;At &rsquo;em, good stick!&rsquo; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>the wand
flew out of his hand and administered on mother and son a sounder
drubbing than that they had themselves been administering. Ever after
that he was able to live at home in peace, for everyone was afraid to
injure him because of the power of his stick.</p>

&lsquo;Bachettone mena!&rsquo; Perhaps the greatest stumbling-block in
the way of acquiring familiarity with the art of conversing in Italian
is the capricious use of the augmentative and diminutive terminations
of words. Scarcely any substantive or adjective comes out of the mouth
of an Italian without qualifications of this sort, making the spoken
quite different from the written language. A foreigner can never arrive
at the right use of these, because they have to be made up at the
moment of use, upon no established laws, but entirely by a sort of
instinctive perception of fitness. At Note 1 and 3 to &lsquo;Il
Poveretto,&rsquo; and other places, I have given some specimens of some
of the most ordinary of these transformations. In the instance before
us, &lsquo;bacchettone,&rsquo; from &lsquo;bacchetta,&rsquo; a rod,
presents two distinct irregularities. The augmentative of a feminine
noun never ought strictly to be &lsquo;<i>ona</i>;&rsquo; but there are
numerous instances, scarcely to be remembered under the largest
practice, in which a feminine noun takes a masculine augmentative.
&lsquo;Bacchetta&rsquo; happens to be one of these. Next, the addition
&lsquo;<i>one</i>&rsquo; would ordinarily express that the thing to
whose designation it was added was particularly big; yet in this
instance it is applied to a <i>little wand</i>; it is clear, therefore,
that it no longer means &lsquo;big,&rsquo; but &lsquo;singular,&rsquo;
&lsquo;remarkable&rsquo; in some way or other; best rendered in English
by &lsquo;good stick.&rsquo; &lsquo;Menare,&rsquo; whence
&lsquo;mena,&rsquo; is a word of many meanings, which, though they may
be all traced to the same original idea, must not be confounded. In
common parlance, as in the present case, it means to beat; and
&lsquo;menar moglie&rsquo; is a common expression too; but it does not
mean &lsquo;to beat your wife,&rsquo; but &lsquo;to lead home a
wife,&rsquo; or, as we say, to &lsquo;take a wife.&rsquo; The primary
meaning is &lsquo;to lead;&rsquo; hence, to govern; hence, to govern
harshly; hence, to govern with violence; hence, to spite, to beat. One
sentence in which it is used recalls a capricious use of our own word
&lsquo;to beat.&rsquo; &lsquo;Menar&rsquo; il cane per
l&rsquo;aja&rsquo; (literally, to lead the dog all about the
threshing-floor), answers exactly to our expression, &lsquo;to
<i>beat</i> about the bush&rsquo; in talking. &lsquo;Menare&rsquo; and
&lsquo;dimenare, la coda,&rsquo; is said also of a dog wagging his
tail. On the other hand, &lsquo;menare per il naso&rsquo; (literally,
&lsquo;to lead one by the nose&rsquo;), has by no means the
signification those words bear in English, but implies a roundabout way
of giving an account of anything.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<h2 class="main"><i>THE DARK KING.</i><a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They say there was once a poor chicory-gatherer who
went out every day with his wife and his three daughters to gather
chicory to sell for salad. Once, at Carneval time, he said, &lsquo;We
must gather a fine good lot to-day,&rsquo; and they all dispersed
themselves about trying to do their best. The youngest daughter thus
came to a place apart where the chicory was of a much finer growth than
any she had ever seen before. &lsquo;This will be grand!&rsquo; she
said to herself, as she prepared to pull up the finest plant of it. But
what was her surprise when with the plant, up came all the earth round
it and a great hole only remained!</p>
<p>When she peeped down into it timidly she was further surprised to
find it was no dark cave below as she had apprehended, but a bright
apartment handsomely furnished, and a most appetising meal spread out
on the table, there was, moreover, a commodious staircase reaching to
the soil on which she stood, to descend by.</p>
<p>All fear was quickly overcome by the pleasant sight, and the girl at
once prepared to descend, and, as no one appeared, to raise any
objection, she sat down quite boldly and partook of the good food. As
soon as she had finished eating, the tables were cleared away by
invisible hands, and, as she had nothing else to do she wandered about
the place looking at everything. After she had passed through several
brilliant rooms she came to a passage, out of which led several
store-chambers, where was laid up a good supply of everything that
could serve in a house. In some there were provisions of all sorts, in
some stuffs both for clothes and furniture.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There seems to be no one to own all these fine things,&rsquo;
said the girl. &lsquo;What a boon they would be at home!&rsquo; and she
put together all that would be most useful to her mother. But what was
her dismay when she went back <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100"
href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>to the dining-hall to find
that the staircase by which she had descended was no longer there!</p>
<p>At this sight she sat down and had a good cry, but by-and-by,
supper-time came, and with it an excellent supper, served in as
mysterious a way as the dinner; and as a good supper was a rare
enjoyment for her, she almost forgot her grief while discussing it.
After that, invisible hands led her into a bedroom, where she was
gently undressed and put to bed without seeing anyone. In the morning
she was put in a bath and dressed by invisible hands, but dressed like
a princess all in beautiful clothes.</p>
<p>So it all went on for at least three months; every luxury she could
wish was provided without stint, but as she never saw anyone she began
to get weary, and at last <i>so</i> weary that she could do nothing but
cry. At the sound of her crying there came into the room a great black
King.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3385src" href="#xd26e3385" name=
"xd26e3385src">2</a> Though he was so dark and so big that she was
frightened at the sight of him, he spoke very kindly, and asked her why
she cried so bitterly, and whether she was not provided with everything
she could desire. As she hardly knew herself why she cried, she did not
know what to answer him, but only went on whimpering. Then he said,
&lsquo;You have not seen half the extent of this palace yet or you
would not be so weary; here are the keys of all the locked rooms which
you have not been into yet. Amuse yourself as much as you like in going
through them; they are all just like your own. Only into the room of
which the key is not among these do not try to enter. In all the rest
do what you like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next morning she took the keys and went into one of the locked
rooms, and there she found so many things to surprise and amuse her
that she spent the whole day there, and the next day she examined
another, and so on for quite three months together, and the locked room
of which she had not the key she never thought of trying to enter. But
all amusements tire at last, and at the end of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>this
time she was so melancholy that she could do nothing but cry. Then the
Dark King came again and asked her tenderly what she wanted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want nothing you can give me,&rsquo; she replied this time.
&lsquo;I am tired of being so long away from home. I want to go back
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But remember how badly you were clothed, and how poorly you
fared,&rsquo; replied the Dark King.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I know it is much pleasanter here,&rsquo; said the girl,
&lsquo;for all those matters, but one cannot do without seeing
one&rsquo;s relations, now and then at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you make such a point of it,&rsquo; answered the Dark
King, &lsquo;you shall go home and see papa and mamma, but you will
come back here. I only let you go on that condition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The arrangement was accepted, and next day she was driven home in a
fine coach with prancing horses and bright harness. Her appearance at
home caused so much astonishment that there was hardly room for
pleasure, and even her own mother would hardly acknowledge her; as for
her sisters, they were so changed by her altered circumstances and so
filled with jealousy they would scarcely speak to her. But when she
gave her mother a large pot of gold which the Dark King had given her
for the purpose, their hearts were somewhat won back to her, and they
began to ask all manner of questions concerning what had befallen her
during her absence. So much time had been lost at first, however, that
none was left for answering them, and, promising to try and come back
to them soon, she drove away in her splendid coach.</p>
<p>Another three months passed away after this, and at the end of it
she was once more so weary, her tears and cries again called the Dark
King to her side.</p>
<p>Again she confided to him that her great grief was the wish to see
her friends at home. She could not bear being so long without them. To
content her once more he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>promised to let her drive home the
next day; and the next day accordingly she went home.</p>
<p>This time she met with a better reception, and having brought out
her pot of gold at her first arrival, everyone was full of anxiety to
know how it came she had such riches at her disposal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What that pot of money!&rsquo; replied the girl, in a tone of
disparagement. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s nothing. You should see the
beautiful things that are scattered about in my new home, just like
nothing at all;&rsquo; and then she went on to describe the
magnificence of the place, till nothing would satisfy them but that
they should go there too.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s impossible,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;I
promised him not even to mention it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But if he were got rid of, <i>then</i> we might come,&rsquo;
replied the elder sisters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean by &ldquo;got rid of&rdquo;?&rsquo; asked
the youngest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, it is evident he is some bad sort of enchanter, whom it
would be well to rid the earth of. If you were to take this stiletto
and put it into his breast when he is asleep, we might all come down
there and be happy together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I could never do that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you are so selfish you want to keep all for yourself. If
you had any spirit in you, you would burst open that locked door where,
you may depend the best of the treasure is concealed, and then put this
stiletto into the old enchanter, and call us all down to live with
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was in vain she protested she could not be so ungrateful and
cruel; they over-persuaded her with their arguments, and frightened her
so with their reproaches that she went back resolved to do their
bidding.</p>
<p>The next morning she called up all her courage and pushed open the
closed door. Inside were a number of beautiful maidens weaving
glittering raiment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103"
name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; asked the chicory-gatherer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Making raiment for the bride of the Dark King against her
espousals,&rsquo; replied the maidens.</p>
<p>A little further on was a goldsmith and all his men working at all
sorts of splendid ornaments filled with pearls and diamonds and
rubies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; asked the girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Making ornaments for the bride of the Dark King against her
espousals,&rsquo; replied the goldsmiths.</p>
<p>A little further on was a little old hunchback sitting crosslegged,
and patching an old torn coat with a heap of other worn-out clothes
lying about him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; asked the maiden.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mending the rags for the girl to go away in who was to have
been the bride of the Dark King,&rsquo; replied the little old
hunchback.</p>
<p>Beyond the room where this was going on was a passage, and at the
end of this a door, which she also pushed open. It gave entrance to a
room where, on a bed, the Dark King lay asleep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the time to apply the stiletto my sisters gave
me,&rsquo; thought the maiden. &lsquo;I shall never have so good a
chance again. They said he was a horrid old enchanter; let me see if he
looks like one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So saying she took one of the tapers from a golden bracket and held
it near his face. It was true enough; his skin was black, his hair was
grizly and rough, his features crabbed and forbidding.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;re right, there&rsquo;s no doubt. It were better
the earth were rid of him, as they say,&rsquo; she said within herself;
and, steeling herself with this reflection, she plunged the knife into
his breast.</p>
<p>But as she wielded the weapon with the right hand, the left, in
which she held the lighted taper, wavered, and some of the scalding wax
fell on the forehead of the Dark King. The dropping of the wax<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3461src" href="#xd26e3461" name="xd26e3461src">3</a>
woke him; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>when he saw the blood flowing from his breast,
and perceived what she had done, he said sadly,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why have you done this? I meant well by you and really loved
you, and thought if I fulfilled all you desire, you would in time have
loved me. But it is over now. You must leave this place, and go back to
be again what you were before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he called servants, and bade them dress her again in her poor
chicory-gatherer&rsquo;s dress, and send her up to earth again; and it
was done. But as they were about to lead her away, he said again,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet one thing I will do. Take these three hairs; and if ever
you are in dire distress and peril of life with none to help, burn
them, and I will come to deliver you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then they took her back to the dining-hall, where the staircase was
seen as at the first, and when they touched the ceiling, it opened, and
they pushed her through the opening, and she found herself in the place
where she had been picking chicory on the day that she first found the
Dark King&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>Only as they were leading her along, she had considered that it
might be dangerous for her, a young girl, to be wandering about the
face of the country alone, and she had, therefore, begged the servants
to give her a man&rsquo;s clothes instead of her own; and they gave her
the worn-out clothes that she had seen the little old hunchback sitting
crosslegged to mend.</p>
<p>When she found herself on the chicory-bed it was in the cold of the
early morning, and she set off walking towards her parents&rsquo;
cottage. It was about midday when she arrived, and all the family were
taking their meal. Poor as it was, it looked very tempting to her who
had tasted nothing all the morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; cried the mother, as she came up to the
door. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m your own child, your youngest daughter. Don&rsquo;t
you know me?&rsquo; cried the forlorn girl in alarm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A likely joke!&rsquo; laughed out the mother; &lsquo;my
daughter comes to see me in a gilded coach with prancing
horses!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had you asked for a bit of bread in the honest character of a
beggar,&rsquo; pursued the father, &lsquo;poor as I am, I would never
have refused your weary, woebegone looks; but to attempt to deceive
with such a falsehood is not to be tolerated;&rsquo; and he rose up,
and drove the poor child away.</p>
<p>Protests were vain, for no one recognised her under her
disguise.</p>
<p>Mournful and hopeless, she wandered away. On, on, on, she went, till
at last she came to a palace in a great city, and in the stables were a
number of grooms and their helpers rubbing down horses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t there be a place for me among all these
boys?&rsquo; asked the little chicory-gatherer, plaintively. &lsquo;I,
too, could learn to rub down a horse if you taught me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t look hardly strong enough to rub down a
horse, my lad,&rsquo; answered the head-groom; &lsquo;but you seem a
civil-spoken sort of chap, so you may come in; I dare say we can find
some sort of work for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So she went into the stable-yard, and helped the grooms of the
palace.</p>
<p>But every day the queen stood at a window of the palace where she
could watch the fair stable-boy, and at last she sent and called the
head-groom, and said to him, &lsquo;What are you doing with that new
boy in the stable-yard?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The head-groom said, &lsquo;Please your Majesty he came and begged
for work, and we took him to help.<span class="corr" id="xd26e3502"
title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>Then the queen said, &lsquo;He is not fit for that sort of work,
send him to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the chicory-gatherer was sent up to the queen, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>the
queen gave her the post of master of the palace, and appointed a fine
suite of apartments and a dress becoming the rank, and was never happy
unless she had this new master of the palace with her.</p>
<p>Now the king was gone to the wars, and had been a long time absent.
One day the queen said to the master of the palace that very likely the
king would not come back, so that it would be better they should
marry.</p>
<p>Then the poor chicory-gatherer was sadly afraid that if the queen
discovered that she was a woman she would lose her fine place at the
palace, and become a poor beggar again without a home; so she said
nothing of this, but only reasoned with the queen that it was better to
wait and see if the king did not come home. But as she continued saying
this, and at the same time never showed any wish that the king might
not come back, or that the marriage might take place, the queen grew
sorely offended, and swore she would be avenged.</p>
<p>Not long after, the king really did come back, covered with glory,
from the wars. Now was the time for the queen to take her revenge.</p>
<p>Choosing her opportunity, therefore, at the moment when the king was
rejoicing that he had been permitted to come back to her again, with
hypocritical tears she said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is no small mercy, indeed, that your Majesty has found me
again here as I am, for it had well-nigh been a very different
case.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The king was instantly filled with burning indignation, and asked
her further what her words meant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They mean,&rsquo; replied the queen, &lsquo;that the master
of the palace, on whom I had bestowed the office only because he seemed
so simple, as you too must say he looks, presumed on my favour, and
would have me marry him, urging that peradventure the king, who had
been so long absent at the wars, might never return.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>The king started to his feet at the words, placing his hand upon his
sword in token of his wrath; but the queen went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when he found that I would not listen to his suit, he
dared to assume a tone of command, and would have compelled me to
consent; so that I had to call forth all my courage, and determination,
and dignity, to keep him back; and had the King&rsquo;s Majesty not
been directed back to the palace as soon as he was, who knows where it
might have ended!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It needed no more. The king ordered the master of the palace to be
instantly thrown into prison, and appointed the next day for him to be
beheaded.</p>
<p>The chicory-gatherer was ready enough now to protest that she was a
woman. But it helped nothing; they only laughed. And who could stand
against the word of the queen?</p>
<p>Next day, accordingly, the scaffold was raised, and the master of
the palace was brought forth to be beheaded, the king and the queen,
and all the court, being present.</p>
<p>When the chicory-gatherer, therefore, found herself in dire need and
peril of life, she took out one of the hairs the Dark King had given
her, and burnt it in the flame of a torch. Instantly there was a
distant roaring sound as of a tramp of troops and the roll of drums.
Everyone started at the sound, and the executioner stayed his hand.</p>
<p>Then the maiden burnt the second hair, and instantly a vast army
surrounded the whole place; round the palace they marched and up to the
scaffold, and so to the very throne of the king. The king had now
something to think of besides giving the signal for the execution, and
the headsman stayed his hand.</p>
<p>Then the maiden burnt the third hair, and instantly the Dark King
himself appeared upon the scene, clothed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>in shining armour,
and fearful in majesty and might. And he said to the king,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who are you that you have given over my wife to the
executioner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the king said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is thy wife that I should give her to the
executioner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Dark King, taking the master of the palace by the hand,
said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is my wife. Touch her who dares!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the king knew that it had been true when the master of the
palace had alleged that she was not guilty of the charge the queen had
brought against her, being a woman; and seeing clearly what had been
the malice of the queen, he ordered the executioner to behead her
instead, but the chicory-gatherer he gave up to the Dark King.</p>
<p>Then the Dark King said to the chicory-gatherer,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came at your bidding to defend you, and I said you were my
wife to save your life; but whether you will be my wife or not depends
on you. It is for you to say whether you will or not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the maiden answered,</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have been all goodness to me; ungrateful indeed should I
be did I not, as I now do, say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she said &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; the earth shook, and she was
no longer standing on a scaffold, but before an altar in a splendid
cathedral, surrounded by a populous and flourishing city. By her side
stood the Black King, but black no longer. He was now a most beautiful
prince; for with all his kingdom he had been under enchantment, and the
condition of his release had been that a fair maiden should give her
free consent to marry him.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3569src" href=

<p class="footnote cont">This is one of those rough verses with which
such stories abound, and they have been rendered rougher than they
originally were by substituting words which serve to retain the jingle
after those conveying the sense are forgotten, like many of our own
nursery-rhymes. The literal rendering of this one would be, &lsquo;So
the marriage was celebrated with bread and hunches of bread, and a
chicken stuffed with vermicelli. Long live the bride!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Vermiciosa&rsquo; is not a dictionary word;
&lsquo;vermicoloso&rsquo; is the nearest, and probably a corruption of
the same. Of course, primarily it means &lsquo;full of worms;&rsquo;
but as all the forms of words compounded out of the diminutive of
&lsquo;verme,&rsquo; a worm, may be applied to the fine kind of
maccaroni which bears the same name, I am more inclined to think a fowl
stuffed or served up with maccaroni is meant here&mdash;if it have any
meaning at all beyond the purpose of a rhyme&mdash;rather than &lsquo;a
wormy fowl,&rsquo; the literal interpretation.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">I have met this same &lsquo;tag&rsquo; again

<p class="first">There was a father who had three daughters, and when
all trades failed, he said he would go and gather chicory, and called
his daughters to go with him. But it was a wet day, and they begged to
be left at home; so he went alone.</p>
<p>He went out into the fields till he came to a place where was the
biggest plant of chicory that ever was seen. &lsquo;That will do for
me,&rsquo; he said, and began to pull it up. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>Up
it came by the root and left a hole in the ground, and a voice came up
through the hole, and said, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Friends!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3620src" href=
"#xd26e3620" name="xd26e3620src">2</a> answered the chicory-gatherer;
and then One sprang up through the hole on to the ground. This was
Monsu Mostro. The poor man was rather frightened at his aspect, but he
dared say nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come along with me,&rsquo; said Monsu Mostro and the poor man
followed till they came to a palace in the Campagna, where he gave him
a horse to ride home upon and a heap of money. &lsquo;I give you all
this,&rsquo; said Monsu Mostro; &lsquo;but you must give me one of your
daughters in return.&rsquo; The poor man was too frightened to refuse,
so he said he would.</p>
<p>When he came home all his three daughters came jumping round him
with delight at seeing him come home riding on horseback. &lsquo;Papa!
papa!<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3629src" href="#xd26e3629" name=
"xd26e3629src">3</a> where have you been?&rsquo; And when they saw what
a lot of money he had brought home, their questions increased tenfold.
But, in spite of his riches, the chicory-gatherer did not seem in good
spirits. He did not know how to announce that he had to take one of his
daughters to Monsu Mostro, and so he was very slow at answering their
inquiries. It was not till next morning that he made up his mind to
break this dreadful matter; and then, when the time had come for him to
go forth, and there was no putting it off any longer, he made a great
effort and said at last, &lsquo;I have found a husband for one of you;
which shall it be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I!&rsquo; said the eldest; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to
marry a husband whom I haven&rsquo;t seen. Oibo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I!&rsquo; said the second. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to
marry a husband whom I haven&rsquo;t seen. Oibo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take me, papa! take me! I&rsquo;ll go!&rsquo; said the
youngest. So the father remounted the horse, and put her behind him.
Thus they arrived at the palace of Monsu Mostro, and knocked.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; said a voice within.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Friends!&rsquo; answered the father; and they were shown
in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s my daughter, as I promised,&rsquo; said the
father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; said Monsu Mostro; and, giving him another
large sum of money, sent him away.</p>
<p>When the father was gone, he said to the girl, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not
going to marry you as your father thought. I want you to do the service
of the house. But mind when there is anyone here you always call me
&ldquo;papa.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl promised to do as she was bid, and soon after there was a
knock at the door, and some hunters who had got belated in the Campagna
came to seek hospitality.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let them in, set supper before them; and give them a change
of clothes,&rsquo; said Monsu Mostro; and the girl did as she was bid.
While they were at supper one of the huntsmen kept looking at her, for
she was a beautiful girl, and afterwards he asked her if she would
marry him, for he was the king&rsquo;s son. &lsquo;Oh, shouldn&rsquo;t
I like it!&rsquo; said the girl, &lsquo;but you must ask papa.&rsquo;
The prince asked Monsu Mostro, and as he made no objection, he went and
fetched a great <span class="corr" id="xd26e3654" title=
"Source: cort&eacute;ge">cort&egrave;ge</span>, and took her to the
palace to marry her. As she was going away Monsu Mostro gave her a
comb, wrapped up in paper, and said, &lsquo;Take care of this, and
don&rsquo;t forget you have got it.&rsquo; The girl was too full of her
happiness to pay much heed, but she put it in her bosom and went
away.</p>
<p>As she drove along, a pair of horns like a cow&rsquo;s began to grow
on her head, and they had already attained a considerable size before
she arrived at the royal palace. The queen was horrified at her
appearance, and refused to let her come in. &lsquo;How can it possibly
be that such a beautiful girl should have all of a sudden got a pair of
horns?&rsquo; said the prince. But it was no use saying anything, for
there were the horns, and the queen was determined that she should not
be admitted into the royal palace. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112"
href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>The prince was very much distressed, and would on no account let her
be turned adrift as the queen wished, but sent her to a house in the
Campagna, where he sent a servant every day to ask how she was, and to
take her some present, but also to observe if the horns had not
perchance gone away as suddenly as they had come. But, instead of going
away, they went on growing every day bigger.</p>
<p>In the meantime the queen sent a servant out with three little
puppy-dogs in a basket, saying that whoever trained them best should
marry the prince. One of these the servant brought to her, and the two
others to two other girls, who were princesses, either of whom the
queen would have preferred her son should marry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Train puppy-dogs!&rsquo; said each of the other two girls.
&lsquo;I know nothing about training puppy-dogs! What can I do with
them!&rsquo; and they let them get into all manner of bad habits.</p>
<p>But <i>she</i> put hers in a basket and went back to the palace of
Monsu Mostro, and knocked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; said Monsu Mostro.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s I!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3676src"
href="#xd26e3676" name="xd26e3676src">4</a> answered she; and then she
told him all that had befallen her, and showed him the puppy-dog in the
basket. He looked at it for a moment, but would not let her in, and
only cried out, &lsquo;Go along! you ugly horned thing!&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3682src" href="#xd26e3682" name=
"xd26e3682src">5</a></p>
<p>She went away crying; but having lifted up the cloth and peeped at
the puppy-dog, she felt reassured, and sent it back by a servant to the
queen.</p>
<p>When the queen uncovered the basket a beautiful little dog sprang
out all of solid gold, yet it leaped about and performed all manner of
tricks just as if it had been a real dog.</p>
<p>The prince was triumphant when he saw that <i>her</i> dog was so
much better than the other two; but the queen was indignant, and said,
&lsquo;It is no dog at all, that gold <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>thing!&rsquo; and she
would not allow that the girl had won the trial.</p>
<p>After that the queen sent a servant out with three pounds of flax,
and said that whoever could spin it best should marry the prince.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do I know about spinning!&rsquo; said each of the other
two; and they let the flax lie without touching it.</p>
<p>But <i>she</i> took hers in a basket and went to the palace of Monsu
Mostro, and knocked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; asked he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s I!&rsquo; she replied in her doleful voice, and
told him her new difficulty. Monsu Mostro looked at the flax, but
refused to admit her, and saying, &lsquo;Away with you, you horned
wretch!&rsquo; shut the door against her.</p>
<p>This basket, too, she sent by a servant to the queen, and when the
queen opened it she found it full of gold thread.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must allow she has done better than the others this
time!&rsquo; said the prince.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No! it is as bad as before,&rsquo; answered the queen;
&lsquo;it is not natural! It won&rsquo;t do for me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;After that the queen sent out a notice that whichever of them
had her hair growing down to her heels should marry the prince.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My hair does not reach down to my waist,&rsquo; said each of
the other two. &lsquo;How can I make it grow down to my
heels?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But <i>she</i> went to the palace of Monsu Mostro, and knocked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; asked he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is I!&rsquo; she replied, as dolefully as before, and told
him what was required of her now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see now what it is to have paid no attention to what I
told you,&rsquo; answered Monsu Mostro. &lsquo;I told you not to forget
the comb I gave you. If you had not forgotten <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>that
none of this would have happened. That comb is your remedy now;&rsquo;
and with that he shut the door.</p>
<p>But she went home and combed her hair with the comb he had given
her; and not only the horns went away, but her hair grew down quite to
her heels and swept the ground. But the other two were jealous when
they saw that she had beaten them in all three trials, and they came to
her to ask how she made her hair grow, and she sent them to the palace
of Monsu Mostro to ask.</p>
<p>But as they only came out of jealousy, he told them to make
themselves two pitch nightcaps and sleep in them; and when they got up
in the morning, instead of having longer hair, all the hair they had
came off.</p>
<p>But she was at length given to the prince, and they were married
amid great rejoicing.</p>
<p class="editorial">[The two preceding stories represent the Roman
contribution to the stories of visits to the underground world and the
Bluebeard group. I have others (particularly one called &lsquo;Il
Cavolo d<span class="corr" id="xd26e3741" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> Oro&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Golden
Cabbage&rsquo;) more like the general run of them. The two I have
selected have this difference, that in neither instance does the
subterranean ruler represent the Devil. &lsquo;Monsu Mostro,&rsquo; is
most disinterested in his generosity. As usual with the Roman versions,
all that is terrible is eliminated. For other versions, see Ralston,
pp. 98&ndash;100; and for a somewhat similar story, the &lsquo;Water
Snake,&rsquo; p. 116. Much in the Norse, &lsquo;East of the Sun and
West of the Moon,&rsquo; is like the &lsquo;R&egrave; Moro;&rsquo; so
is &lsquo;The Old Dame and her Hen,&rsquo; though the later details of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=

which I have given in &lsquo;Laxehale&rsquo;s Wives,&rsquo; in
&lsquo;Household Stories from the Land of Hofer.&rsquo; The German
version given as &lsquo;Fitchers Vogel,&rsquo; Grimm, p. 177, has more
of the horrid element than any of the others. In the version of
&lsquo;<span lang="hu"><span class="corr" id="xd26e3747" title=

Sagen&rsquo; (a rather different version from that told me at Pesth,
which I have given at p. 20&ndash;1), Prince Argilus loses his bride

looking into a closed chamber which <span lang="hu"><span class="corr"

action abounds in the Hungarian tales, just as it is wanting in the
Roman ones, and in this, and in many details, particularly in the
enthusiasm for magic horses, they are singularly like the Gaelic.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They say there was once a merchant who, when he was
going out to buy rare merchandise, asked his daughter what rich present
he should bring home to her. She, however, would hear of nothing but
only a simple rose-tree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That,&rsquo; said her father, &lsquo;is too easy. However, as
you are bent on having a rose-tree, you shall have the most beautiful
rose-tree I can find in all my travels.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In all his travels, however, he met with no rose-tree that he deemed
choice enough. But one day, when he was walking outside the walls of
his own city, he came to a garden which he had never observed before,
filled with all manner of beautiful flowers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a wonderful garden indeed,&rsquo; said the merchant
to himself; &lsquo;I never saw it before, and yet these luxuriant
plants seem to have many years&rsquo; growth in them. There must be
something wonderful about them, so this is just <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>the
place to look for my daughter&rsquo;s rose-tree.&rsquo; In he went
therefore to look for the rose-tree.</p>
<p>In the midst of the garden was a casino, the door of which stood
open; when he went in he found a banquet spread with the choicest
dishes; and though he saw no one, a kind voice invited him to sit down
and enjoy himself. So he sat down to the banquet, and very much he did
enjoy himself, for there was everything he could desire.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3781src" href="#xd26e3781" name=
"xd26e3781src">2</a></p>
<p>When he had well eaten and drunk, he bethought him to go out again
into the garden and seek a choice rose-tree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As the banquet was free,&rsquo; he thought to himself,
&lsquo;I suppose the flowers are free too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he selected what seemed to him the choicest rose of all; while it
had petals of the richest red in the world, within it was all shining
gold, and the leaves too were overlaid with shining gold. This
rose-tree, therefore, he proceeded to root up.</p>
<p>A peal of thunder attended the attempt, and with a noise of rushing
winds and waters a hideous monster<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3792src"
href="#xd26e3792" name="xd26e3792src">3</a> suddenly appeared before
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How dare you root up my rose-trees?&rsquo; said the monster;
&lsquo;was it not enough that I gave you my best hospitality freely?
Must you also rob me of my flowers, which are as my life to me? Now you
must die!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The merchant excused himself as best he could, saying it was the
very freedom of the hospitality which had emboldened him to take the
rose, and that he had only ventured to take it because he had promised
the prettiest rose-tree he could find to his daughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your daughter, say you?&rsquo; replied the monster. &lsquo;If
there is a daughter in the case perhaps I may forgive you; but only on
condition that you bring her hither to me within three days&rsquo;
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The father went home sad at heart, but within three days he kept his
promise of taking his daughter to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>garden. The monster
received them very kindly, and gave them the casino to live in, where
they were well fed and lodged. At the end of eight days, however, a
voice came to the father and told him he must depart; and when he
hesitated to leave his daughter alone he was taken by invisible agency
and turned out of the garden.</p>
<p>The monster now often came and talked to the daughter, and he was so
gentle and so kind that she began quite to like him. One day she asked
him to let her go home and see her friends, and he, who refused her
nothing, let her go; but begged her to promise solemnly she would come
back at the end of eight days, &lsquo;for if you are away longer than
that,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;I know I shall die of despair.&rsquo;
Then he gave her a mirror into which she could look and see how he
was.</p>
<p>Thus she went home, and the time passed quickly away, and eight days
were gone and she had not thought of returning. Then by accident the
mirror came under her hand, and, looking into it, she saw the monster
stretched on the ground as if at the point of death. The sight filled
her with compunction, and she hurried back with her best speed.</p>
<p>Arrived at the garden, she found the monster just as she had seen
him in the mirror. At sight of her he revived, and soon became so much
better that she was much touched when she saw how deeply he cared for
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And were you really so bad <i>only</i> because I went
away?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not only because you went away, for it was right you
should go and see your parents; but because I began to fear you would
never come back, and if you had never come back I should quite have
died.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now you are all right again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, now you are here I am quite happy; that is, I should be
quite happy if you would promise always to remain and never go away any
more.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then when she saw how earnest and sincere he was in wishing her to
stay, she gave her consent never to leave him more.</p>
<p>No sooner had she spoken the promise than in the twinkling of an eye
all was changed. The monster became a handsome prince, the casino a
palace, the garden a flourishing country, and each several rose-tree a
city. For the prince had been enchanted by an enemy, and had to remain
transformed as a monster till he should be redeemed by the love of a
maiden.</p>
<p class="editorial">[The three brothers who occupy so large a space in
the household tales of other countries, do not seem to be popular
favourites in Rome. I have come across them but seldom. There are
plenty of them in the &lsquo;Norse Tales,&rsquo; under the name of
&lsquo;Boots&rsquo; for the unexpectedly doughty brother. The Spanish
romance I have given as &lsquo;Simple Johnny and the Spell-bound
Princesses,&rsquo; in &lsquo;Patra&ntilde;as,&rsquo; makes him a
knight. In the Siddhi K&uuml;r story of &lsquo;How the Schimnu Khan was
Slain,&rsquo; it is three hired companions (as in some other versions),
who betray the hero; and in all but this (which is its link with the
usual Three-brother stories), it is a remarkably close repetition of
the details of another Spanish romance, which I have given as
&lsquo;The Ill-tempered Princess,&rsquo; and this, in its turn, is like
the Tirolean &lsquo;Laxhale&rsquo;s Wives&rsquo; and the Roman

number of instances collected by Mr. Ralston, pp. 72&ndash;80, and
260&ndash;7. In many parts of Tirol you meet a Three-brother story
different from any of these. Three brothers go out to hunt chamois on a
Sunday morning, and get so excited with the sport that they make
themselves too late to hear Mass, and get turned into stone, or some
other dreadful punishment. The younger brother, who has all along urged
them to go down, but has been overruled by the others, is involved in
the same punishment. There are three peaks on the Knie Pass, leading
from Tirol to Salzburg, called &lsquo;The Three Brothers,&rsquo; from
such a legend.]</p>

According to the narrator, there was a dish of &lsquo;pasta&rsquo;
heaped up like a mountain; and &lsquo;souplis di riso con
rigaglie&rsquo; and &lsquo;capone con contorni,&rsquo; and several
kinds of wine. I give this description verbally, as it was given to me,
as characteristic of the local colouring such legends receive. The
dishes named are the favourites of the Roman middle class.
&lsquo;Pasta&rsquo; is the Roman equivalent for the
&lsquo;maccaroni&rsquo; of the Neapolitan. &lsquo;Rigaglie&rsquo; is
the liver, &amp;c., of poultry minced, to put into the fried balls of
rice. &lsquo;Contorni&rsquo; means something more than
&lsquo;garnish,&rsquo; being something put round the dish, not merely
for ornament, but more or less substantial, to be eaten with it, as
sausages round a turkey.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first">Once upon a time there were three brothers, who were
woodmen; their employment was not one which required great skill, and
they were none of them very clever, but the youngest was the least
brilliant of all. So simple was he that all the neighbours, and his
very brothers&mdash;albeit they were not so very superior in
intelligence themselves&mdash;gave him the nickname of
&lsquo;Scioccolone,&rsquo; the great simpleton, and accordingly
Scioccolone he was called wherever he went.</p>
<p>Every day these three brothers went out into the woods to their
work, and every evening they all came home, each staggering under his
load of wood, which he carried to the dealer who paid them for their
toil: thus one day of labour passed away just like another in all
respects. So it went on for years.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one day came at last which was not at all like the
others, and if all days were like it the world would be quite upside
down, or be at least a very different world from what it is.
<i>Oim&egrave;!</i> that such days never occur now at all!
<i>Basta</i>, this is what happened. It was in the noontide heat of a
very hot day, the three simple brothers <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>committed the
imprudence of going out of the shelter of the woods into the wold
beyond, and there, lying on the grass in the severest blaze of the
burning sun, they saw three beautiful peasant girls lying fast
asleep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only look at those silly girls sleeping in the full blaze of
the sun!&rsquo; cried the eldest brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ll get bad in their heads in this heat,&rsquo;
said the second.</p>
<p>But Scioccolone said: &lsquo;Shall we not get some sticks and
boughs, and make a little shed to shelter them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just like one of Scioccolone&rsquo;s fine ideas!&rsquo;
laughed the eldest brother scornfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done, Scioccolone! That&rsquo;s the best thing
you&rsquo;ve thought of this long while. And who will build a shed over
us while we&rsquo;re building a shed for the girls, I should like to
know?&rsquo; said the second.</p>
<p>But Scioccolone said: &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t leave them there like
that; they will be burnt to death. If you won&rsquo;t help me I must
build the shed alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A wise resolve, and worthy of Scioccolone!&rsquo; scoffed the
eldest brother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Scioccolone!&rsquo; cried the second, as the two
elder brothers walked away together. &lsquo;Good-bye for ever! I
don&rsquo;t expect ever to see you alive again, of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And they never did see him again, but what it was that happened to
him you shall hear.</p>
<p>Without waiting to find a retort to his brothers&rsquo; gibes,
Scioccolone set to work to fell four stout young saplings, and to set
them up as supports of his shed in four holes he had previously scooped
with the aid of his bill-hook; then he rammed them in with wedges,
which he also had to cut and shape. After this he cut four large bushy
branches, which he tied to the uprights with the cord he used for tying
up his faggots of logs; and as the shade of these was scarcely close
enough to keep out all the fierce rays of the sun, he went back to the
wood and collected all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href=
"#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>the large broad leaves he could
find, and came back and spread them out over his leafy roof. All this
was very hard labour indeed when performed under the dreaded sun, and
just in the hours when men do no work; yet so beautiful were the three
maidens that, when at last he had completed his task, he could not tear
himself away from them to go and seek repose in the shade of the wood,
but he must needs continue standing in the full sun gazing at them
open-mouthed.</p>
<p>At last the three beautiful maidens awoke, and when they saw what a
fragrant shade had refreshed their slumbers they began pouring out
their gratitude to their devoted benefactor.</p>
<p>Do not run at hasty conclusions, however, and imagine that of course
the three beautiful maidens fell in love on the spot with Scioccolone,
and he had only to pick and choose which of them he would have to make
him happy as his wife. A very proper ending, you say, for a fairy tale.
It was not so, however. Scioccolone looked anything but attractive just
then. His meaningless features and uncouth, clownish gait were never at
any time likely to inspire the fair maidens with sudden affection; but
just then, after his running hither and thither, his felling, digging,
and hammering in the heat of the day, his face had acquired a tint
which made it look rougher and redder and more repulsive than anyone
ever wore before.</p>
<p>Besides this, the three maidens were fairies, who had taken the
form<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3887src" href="#xd26e3887" name=
"xd26e3887src">2</a> of beautiful peasant girls for some reason of
their own.</p>
<p>But neither did they leave his good deed unrewarded. By no means.
Each of the three declared she would give him such a precious gift that
he should own to his last hour that they were not ungrateful. So they
sat and thought what great gift they could think of which should be
calculated to make him very happy indeed.</p>
<p>At last the first of the three got up and exclaimed that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>she had thought of her gift, and she did not
think anyone could give him a greater one; for she would promise him he
should one day be a king.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that a fine gift!</p>
<p>Scioccolone, however, did not think so. The idea of <i>his</i> being
a king! Simple as he was, he could see the incongruity of the idea, and
the embarrassment of the situation. How should he the poor clown,
everybody&rsquo;s laughingstock, become a king? and if he did, kingship
had no attractions for him.</p>
<p>He was too kind-hearted, however, to say anything in disparagement
of the well-meant promise, and too straightforward to assume a show of
gratitude he did not feel; so after the first little burst of hilarity
which he was not sufficiently master of himself to suppress, he
remained standing open-mouthed after his awkward manner.</p>
<p>Then the second fairy addressed him and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see you don&rsquo;t quite like my sister&rsquo;s gift; but
you may be sure she would not have promised it if it had not been a
good gift, after you have been so kind to us; and when it comes true,
it will somehow all turn out very nice and right. But now, meantime,
that I may not similarly disappoint you with my gift by choosing it for
you, I shall let you choose it for yourself; so say, what shall it
be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Scioccolone was almost as much embarrassed with the second
fairy&rsquo;s permission of choosing for himself as he had been with
the first fairy&rsquo;s choice for him. First he grinned, and then he
twisted his great awkward mouth about, and then he grinned again, till,
at last, ashamed of keeping the fairies waiting so long for his answer,
he said, with another grin:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, to tell you what I should <i>really</i> like, it would
be that when I have finished making up my faggot of logs this evening,
instead of having to stagger home <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123"
href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>carrying it, it should roll
along by itself, and then I get astride of <i>it</i>, and that it
should carry <i>me</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That <i>would</i> be fine!&rsquo; he added, and he grinned
again as he thought of the fun it would be to be carried home by the
load of logs instead of carrying the load as he had been wont.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly! That wish is granted,&rsquo; replied the second
fairy readily. &lsquo;You will find it all happen just as you have
described.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the third fairy came forward and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now choose; what shall <i>my</i> gift be? You have only
to ask for whatever you like and you shall have it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such a heap of wishes rose up in Scioccolone&rsquo;s imagination at
this announcement, that he could not make up his mind which to select;
as fast as he fixed on one thing, he remembered it would be incomplete
without some other gift, and as he went on trying to find some one wish
that should be as comprehensive as possible, he suddenly blurted
out&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Promise me that <i>whatever</i> I wish may come true;
that&rsquo;ll be the best gift; and so if I forget a thing one moment I
can wish for it the next. That&rsquo;ll be the best gift to be
sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Granted!&rsquo; said the third fairy. &lsquo;You have only to
wish for anything and you will find you get it immediately, whatever it
is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fairies then took leave and went their way, and Scioccolone was
reminded by the lengthening shades that it was time he betook himself
to complete his day&rsquo;s work. Scarcely succeeding in collecting his
thoughts, so dazzled and bewildered was he by the late supernatural
conversation, he yet found his way back to the spot where he had been
felling wood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear! how tired I am!&rsquo; he said within himself as he
walked along. &lsquo;How I wish the wood was all felled and the faggots
tied up!&rsquo; and though he said this <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>mechanically as he
might have said it any other day of his life, without thinking of the
fairy&rsquo;s promise, which was, indeed, too vast for him to put it
consciously to such a practical test then, full of astonishment as he
was, yet when he got back to his working-place the wood <i>was</i>
felled and laid in order, and tied into a faggot in the best
manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well to be sure!&rsquo; soliloquised Scioccolone. &lsquo;The
girls have kept their promise indeed! This is just exactly what I
wished. And now, let&rsquo;s see what else did I wish? Oh, yes; that if
I got astride on the faggot it should roll along by itself and carry me
with it; let&rsquo;s see if that&rsquo;ll come true too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that he got astride on the faggot, and sure enough the faggot
moved on all by itself, and carried Scioccolone along with it
pleasantly enough.</p>
<p>Only there was one thing Scioccolone had forgotten to ask for, and
that was power to guide the faggot; and now, though it took a direction
quite contrary to that of his homeward way, he had no means of inducing
it to change its tack. After some time spent in fruitless efforts in
schooling his unruly mount, Scioccolone began to reason with
himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After all, it does not much matter about going home. I only
get laughed at and called &ldquo;Scioccolone.&rdquo; Maybe in some
other place they may be better, and as the faggot is acting under the
orders of my benefactress, it will doubtless all be for the
best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he committed himself to the faggot to take him wherever it would.
On went the faggot surely and steadily, as if quite conscious where it
had to go; and thus, before nightfall, it came to a great city where
were many people, who all came out to see the wonder of the faggot of
logs moving along by itself, and a man riding on it.</p>
<p>In this city was a king, who lived in a palace with an only
daughter. Now this daughter had never been known <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>to
laugh. What pains soever the king her father took to divert her were
all unavailing; nothing brought a smile to her lips.</p>
<p>Now, however, when all the people ran to the windows to see a man
riding on a faggot, the king&rsquo;s daughter ran to look out too; and
when she saw the faggot moving by itself, and the uncouth figure of
Scioccolone sitting on it, and heard all the people laughing at the
sight, then the king&rsquo;s daughter laughed too; laughed for the
first time in her life.</p>
<p>But Scioccolone passing under the palace, heard her clear and merry
laugh resounding above the laughter of all the people, he looked up and
saw her, and when he saw her looking so bright and fair he said within
himself:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, if ever the fairy&rsquo;s power of wishing is to be of
use to me, I wish that I might have a little son, and that the
beautiful princess should be the mother.&rsquo; But he did not think of
wishing to stop there that he might look at her, so the faggot carried
him past the palace and past all the houses into the outskirts of the
city, till he got tired and weary, and just then passing a wood
merchant&rsquo;s yard, the thought rose to his lips,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish that wood merchant would buy this faggot of
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Immediately the wood merchant came out and offered to buy the
faggot, and as it was such a wonderful faggot, that he thought
Scioccolone would never consent to sell it, he offered him such a high
price that Scioccolone had enough to live on like a prince for a
year.</p>
<p>After a time there was again a great stir in the city, everyone was
abroad in the streets whispering and consulting. To the king&rsquo;s
daughter was born a little son, and no one knew who the father was, not
even the princess herself. Then the king sent for all the men in the
city, and brought them to the infant, and said, &lsquo;Is this your
father?&rsquo; but the babe said &lsquo;No!&rsquo; to them all.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p>Last of all, Scioccolone was brought, and when the king took him up
to the babe and said, &lsquo;Is this your father?&rsquo; the babe rose
joyfully from its cradle and said, &lsquo;Yes; that is my
father!&rsquo; When the king heard this and saw what a rough ugly clown
Scioccolone was, he was very angry with his daughter, and said she must
marry him and go away for ever from the palace. It was all in vain that
the princess protested she had never seen him but for one moment from
the top of the palace. The babe protested quite positively that he was
his father; so the king had them married, and sent them away from the
palace for ever; and the babe was right, for though Scioccolone and the
princess had never met, Scioccolone had wished that he might have a
son, of whom she should be the mother, and by the power of the
spell<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3990src" href="#xd26e3990" name=
"xd26e3990src">3</a> the child was born.</p>
<p>Scioccolone was only too delighted with the king&rsquo;s angry
decree. He felt quite out of place in the palace, and was glad enough
to be sent away from it. All he wanted was to have such a beautiful
wife, and he willingly obeyed the king&rsquo;s command to take her
away, a long, long way off.</p>
<p>The princess, however, was quite of a different mind. She could not
cease from crying, because she was given to such an uncouth, clownish
husband that no tidy peasant wench would have married.</p>
<p>When, therefore, Scioccolone saw his beautiful bride so unhappy and
distressed, he grew distressed himself; and in his distress he
remembered once more the promise of the fairy, that whatever he wished
he might have, and he began wishing away at once. First he wished for a
pleasant villa,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3999src" href="#xd26e3999"
name="xd26e3999src">4</a> prettily laid-out, and planted, and walled;
then, a casino<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4002src" href="#xd26e4002"
name="xd26e4002src">5</a> in the midst of it, prettily furnished, and
having plenty of pastimes and diversions; then, for a farm,
well-stocked with beasts for all kinds of uses; for carriages and
servants, for fruits and flowers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>and all that can make life
pleasant. And when he found that with all these things the princess did
not seem much happier than before, he bethought himself of wishing that
he might be furnished with a handsome person, polished manners, and an
educated mind, altogether such as the princess wished. All his wishes
were fulfilled, and the princess now loved him very much, and they
lived very happily together.</p>
<p>After they had been living thus some time, it happened one day that
the king, going out hunting, observed this pleasant villa on the wold,
where heretofore all had been bare, unplanted, and unbuilt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is this!&rsquo; cried the king; and he drew rein, and
went into the villa intending to inquire how the change had come
about.</p>
<p>Scioccolone came out to meet him, not only so transformed that the
king never recognised him, but so distinguished by courtesy and
urbanity, that the king himself felt ashamed to question him as to how
the villa had grown up so suddenly. He accepted his invitation to come
and rest in the casino, however; and there they fell to conversing on a
variety of subjects, till the king was so struck with the sagacity and
prudence of Scioccolone&rsquo;s talk, that when he rose to take leave,
he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such a man as you I have long sought to succeed me in the
government of the kingdom. I am growing old and have no children, and
you are worthy in all ways to wear the crown. Come up, therefore, if
you will, to the palace and live with me, and when I die you shall be
king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Scioccolone, now no longer feeling himself so ill-adapted to live in
a palace, willingly consented, and a few days after, with his wife and
his little son, he went up to the palace to live with the king.</p>
<p>But the king&rsquo;s delight can scarcely be imagined when he found
that the wife of the polished stranger was indeed his very own
daughter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>After a few years the old king died, and Scioccolone reigned in his
stead. And thus the promises of all the three fairies were
fulfilled.</p>
<p class="editorial">[Among the Italian-Tirolese tales is one called
&lsquo;<span lang="it">I tre pezzi rari</span>&rsquo; (The Three Rare
Things), which begins just like &lsquo;<span lang=
"it">Scioccolone</span>,&rsquo; and then the fairies give the three
gifts of a dinner-providing table-cloth, an exhaustless purse, and a
resistless cudgel, which we so often meet with, as in Grimm&rsquo;s
&lsquo;<span lang="de">Tischchen deck dich</span>,&rsquo; p. 142;

boy and two fairies are concerned, and they only give him the one gift
of the Zufoletto, which, instead of supplying every wish as in

power of the Zauberfl&ouml;te, the pipe of the &lsquo;Pied
Piper,&rsquo; and kindred instruments in all times and countries, so
that, when it has got its possessor into such trouble that he is
condemned to be executed, it answers the same end as the cudgel,

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a poor old father, who was very poor indeed,
and very old. When he came to die, he called his three sons round his
bed, and said they must summon a notary to make his will. The sons
looked at each other, and thought he was doating. He repeated his
desire, and then one of them ventured to say:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But father, dear, why should we go to the expense of calling
in a notary; there is not a single thing on earth you have to leave
us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the old man told them again to call a notary, and still they
hesitated, because they thought the notary would say they were making
game of him.</p>
<p>At last the old man began to get angry when he found they would not
do as he said, and, just not to vex him in his last moments, they
called the notary, and the notary brought his witnesses.</p>
<p>Then the father was content, and called them all to his bedside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, pull out the old case under the bed, and take out what
you find there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They found an old broken hat, without a brim, a ragged purse that
was so worn you could not have trusted any money in its keeping, and a
horn.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4065src" href="#xd26e4065" name=
"xd26e4065src">2</a></p>
<p>These three things he bequeathed in due form of law, one to each of
his sons; and it was only because they saw that the man was in his
death agony that those who were called to act as witnesses could keep
from laughing. To the notary, of course, it was all one whether it was
an old hat or a new one, his part was the same, and when he had done
what was needful, he went his way, and the witnesses went with him; but
as they went out, they said one to another: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor old man! perhaps it is a comfort to him in his last
moments to fancy he has got something to leave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they were all gone, as the three sons were standing by, very
sad, and looking at each other, not knowing what to make of the strange
scene, he called the eldest, to whose portion the hat had fallen, and
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;See what I&rsquo;ve given you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, father!&rsquo; answered he, &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t even
good enough to bind round one&rsquo;s knee when one goes out
hoeing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the father answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let you know its value till those people
were gone, lest any should take it from you; this is its value, that if
you put it on, you can go in to dine at whatever inn you please, or sit
down to drink at what wineshop you please, and take what you like and
drink what you like, for no one will see you while you have it
on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he called his second son, to whose lot the purse had fallen,
and he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;See what I have given you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, father!&rsquo; answered the son, &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t
even good enough to keep a little tobacco in, if I could afford to buy
any!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the father answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you its value till those people were
gone, lest any should take it from you; but this is its value; if you
put your fingers in, you&rsquo;ll find a scudo there, and after that
another, and another, as many as ever you will; there will always be
one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he called his youngest son, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;See what I have given you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, father, it&rsquo;s a very nice horn; and when I am
starving hungry I can cheat myself into being content by playing on
it.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Silly boy!&rsquo; answered the father; &lsquo;that is not its
use. I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you its value while those people were here,
lest they should take it from you. Its value is this, that whenever you
want anything you have only to sound it, and one will come who will
bring whatever you want, be it a dinner, a suit of clothes, a palace,
or an army.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this the father died, and each found himself well provided
with the legacy he had given him.</p>
<p>It happened that one day as the second son<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4116src" href="#xd26e4116" name="xd26e4116src">3</a> was passing
under the window of the palace a waiting-maid looked out and said:
&lsquo;Can you play at cards?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As well as most,&rsquo; answered the youth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, then; come up,&rsquo; answered the waiting-maid;
&lsquo;for the queen wants some one to play with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Very readily he went up, therefore, and played at cards with the
queen, and when he had played all the evening he had lost fifty
scudi.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind about paying the fifty scudi,&rsquo; said the
queen, as he rose to leave. &lsquo;We only played to pass away the
time, and you don&rsquo;t look by your dress as if you could afford
fifty scudi.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all!&rsquo; replied the youth. &lsquo;I will certainly
bring the fifty scudi in the morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And in the morning, by putting his fingers fifty times into the
ragged purse, he had the required sum, and went back with it to the
palace and paid the queen.</p>
<p>The queen was very much astonished that such a shabby-looking fellow
should have such command of money, and determined to find out how it
was; so she made him stay and dine. After dinner she took him into her
private room and said to him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me, how comes it that you, who are but a shabby-looking
fellow, have such command of money?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; answered he quite unsuspectingly, &lsquo;because
my father left me a wonderful purse, in which is always a scudo.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; answered the queen. &lsquo;That is a very
pretty fable, but such purses don&rsquo;t exist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but it is so indeed,&rsquo; answered the youth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite impossible,&rsquo; persisted the queen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But here it is; you can see for yourself!&rsquo; pursued the
incautious youth, taking it out.</p>
<p>The queen took it from him as if to try its powers, but no sooner
was she in possession of it than she called in the guard to turn out a
fellow who was trying to rob her, and give him a good beating.</p>
<p>Indignant at such treatment, the youth went to his eldest brother
and begged his hat of him that he might, by its means, go and punish
the queen.</p>
<p>Putting on the hat he went back to the palace at the hour of dinner
and sat down to table. As soon as the queen was served he took her
plate and ate up all that was in it one course after another, so that
the queen got nothing, and finding it useless to call for more dishes,
she gave it up as a bad job, and went into her room. The youth followed
her in and demanded the return of his wonderful purse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I know it is you if I don&rsquo;t see you?&rsquo;
said the queen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind about seeing me. Put the purse out on the table
for me and I will take it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t if I don&rsquo;t see you,&rsquo; replied
the queen. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it is you unless I see
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youth fell into the snare and took off his hat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you manage to make yourself invisible?&rsquo; asked
the queen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just by putting on this old hat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that could make you invisible,&rsquo;
exclaimed the queen. &lsquo;Let me try.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And she snatched the hat out of his hand and put it on. Of course
she was now in turn invisible, and he sought her in vain; but worse
than that, she rang the bell <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=
"#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>for the guard and bid them turn
the shabby youth out and give him a bastonata.</p>
<p>Full of fresh indignation he ran to his youngest brother and told
him all his story, begging the loan of his horn, that he might punish
the queen by its means; and the brother lent it him.</p>
<p>He sounds the horn and One comes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4176src" href="#xd26e4176" name="xd26e4176src">4</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;I want an army with cannons to throw down the palace,&rsquo;
said the youth; and instantly there was a tramp of armed men, and a
rumble of artillery waggons.</p>
<p>The queen was sitting at dinner, but when she heard all the noise
she came to the window; meantime the soldiers had surrounded the palace
and pointed their guns.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s all this about! What&rsquo;s the matter!&rsquo;
cried the queen out of the window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The matter is, that I want my purse and my hat back,&rsquo;
answered the youth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure! you are right; here they are. I don&rsquo;t want
my palace battered down, so I will give them to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youth went up to receive them; but when he got upstairs he found
the queen sunk half fainting in a chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m so frightened; I can&rsquo;t think where I put
the things. Only send away that army and I&rsquo;ll look for them
immediately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youth sent away the army, and the queen got up and began looking
about for the things.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me,&rsquo; she said, as she wandered from one cupboard
to another, &lsquo;how did you, who are such a shabby-looking fellow,
manage to call together such an army?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I&rsquo;ve got this horn,&rsquo; answered the youth.
&lsquo;And with it I can call up whatever I want, and if you
don&rsquo;t make haste and find the purse and the hat, I&rsquo;ll call
up the army again and batter down the palace in right earnest.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t make me believe that!&rsquo; replied the
queen. &lsquo;That sorry horn can&rsquo;t work such wonders as that:
let me try.&rsquo; And she took the horn out of his hands and sounded
it and One appeared. &lsquo;Two stout men!&rsquo; she commanded
quickly; and when they came she bid them drive the shabby-looking youth
out of the palace and give him a bastonata.</p>
<p>He was now quite undone, and was ashamed to go back to his brothers.
So he wandered away outside the town. After much walking he came to a
vineyard, where he strolled in; and what struck him was, that though it
was January, there was a fine fig-tree covered with ripe luscious
figs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a godsend indeed,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to a hungry
man,&rsquo; and he began plucking and eating the figs. Before he had
eaten many, however, he found his nose had begun to grow to a terrible
size; a foot for every fig.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;ll never do!&rsquo; he cried, and left off eating
the figs and wandered on. Presently he came to another vineyard, where
he also strolled in: there, though it was January, he saw a tree all
covered with ripe red cherries. &lsquo;I wonder what calamity will
pursue me for eating them,&rsquo; he said, as he gathered them. But
when he had eaten a good many he perceived that at last his luck had
turned, for in proportion as he ate his nose grew less and less, till
at last it was just the right size again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I know how to punish the queen,&rsquo; he said, and he
filled a bottle with the juice of the cherries, and went back and
gathered a basketful of figs.</p>
<p>These figs he cried under the palace window, and as he had got more
dusty and threadbare with his late wanderings no one recognised him.
&lsquo;Figs in January! that is a treat!&rsquo; and they bought up the
whole basketful. Then as they ate, their noses all began to grow, but
the queen, as she was very greedy, ate twelve for her share, so that
she had twelve feet of nose added to the length of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>hers. It was so long that it trailed behind her
on the ground as she walked along.</p>
<p>Then there was a hue and cry! All the surgeons and physicians in the
kingdom were sent for, but could do no good. They were all in despair,
when our youth came up disguised as a foreign doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Noses! I can heal noses! whoever has got too much nose let
him come to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>All the inhabitants gathered round him, and the queen called to him
loudest of all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The medicine I have to give is necessarily a very strong one
to effect so extraordinary a cure; therefore I won&rsquo;t give it to
the queen&rsquo;s majesty till she has seen it used on all her
servants, beginning with the lowest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Taking them all in order, beginning with the lowest, he gave a few
drops of cherry-juice to each, and all their noses came right.</p>
<p>Last of all the queen remained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The queen can&rsquo;t be treated like common people,&rsquo;
he said; &lsquo;she must be treated by herself. I must go into her room
with her, and I can cure her with one drop of my cordial.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think yourself very clever that you talk of curing with
one drop of your cordial, but you&rsquo;re not the only person who can
work wonders. I&rsquo;ve got greater wonders than yours. I&rsquo;ve got
a hat which makes you invisible, a purse that never is empty, and a
horn that gives you everything you call for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very pretty things to talk about,&rsquo; answered the
pretended doctor, &lsquo;but such things don&rsquo;t exist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t they!&rsquo; said the queen. &lsquo;There they
are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And she laid them all out on the table.</p>
<p>This was enough for him. Taking advantage of the lesson she had
given him by her example, he quickly put on the hat, making himself
invisible; after that it was easy to snatch up the other things and
escape; nor could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136"
name="pb136">136</a>]</span>anyone follow him. He lived very
comfortably for the rest of his life, taking a scudo out of his purse
for whatever he had to pay, and his brothers likewise got on very well
with their legacies, for he restored them as soon as he had rescued
them from the queen. But the queen remained for the rest of her life
with <span class="sc">TWELVE FEET OF NOSE</span>.</p>

<p class="first">There was once a poor orphan youth left all alone,
with no home, and no means of gaining a living, and no place of
shelter.</p>
<p>Not knowing what to do he wandered away over the Campagna, straight
on; when he had wandered all day and was ready to die of hunger and
weariness, he at last saw a fig-tree covered with ripe figs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a godsend!&rsquo; said the poor orphan; and he
set to upon the figs without ceremony. But, lo! he had scarcely eaten
half-a-dozen when his nose began to feel very odd; he put his hand up
to it and it felt much bigger than usual; however, he was too hungry to
trouble himself about it, and he ate on. As he ate on his nose felt
queerer and queerer; he put his hand up and found it was quite a
foot<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4260src" href="#xd26e4260" name=
"xd26e4260src">2</a> long! But he was so hungry he went on eating
still, and before he had done he had fully a yard of nose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A pretty thing I have done for myself now! As well might I
have died of starvation as make myself <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>such an object as
this! Never can I appear among civilised beings again.&rsquo; And he
laid himself down to sleep, hiding himself in the foliage of the
fig-tree lest anybody passing by should see his nose.</p>
<p>In the morning the first thing he thought of when he awoke was his
nose; he had no need to put up his hand to feel it for it reached down
to his hand, a full yard of it waggling about.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no help for it,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I must
keep away from all habitable places, and live as best I may.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he wandered on and on over the Campagna away from all
habitations, straight on; and when he had wandered all day and was
ready to die of hunger and weariness he saw another fig-tree covered
with ripe figs.</p>
<p>Right glad he was to see anything in the shape of food. &lsquo;If it
had only been anything else in the world but figs!&rsquo; he said.
&lsquo;If I go on at this rate I shan&rsquo;t be able to carry my nose
along at all! Yet starving is hard, too, and I&rsquo;m such a figure
now, nothing can make me much worse, so here goes!&rsquo; and he began
eating at the figs without more ado.</p>
<p>As he ate this time, however, his nose, instead of feeling queerer
and queerer as it had before, began to feel lighter and lighter.</p>
<p>Less, less, and still less it grew,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4282src" href="#xd26e4282" name="xd26e4282src">3</a> till at last
he had to put his hand up to feel where it was, and by the time he had
done eating, it was just its natural size again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Now</i> I know how to make my fortune!&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4291src" href="#xd26e4291" name="xd26e4291src">4</a>
he cried, and he danced for delight.</p>
<p>With a basketful of the figs of the first tree he trudged to the
nearest town, still clad in his peasant&rsquo;s dress, and cried,
&lsquo;Fine figs! fine figs! who&rsquo;ll buy my beautiful ripe
figs!&rsquo;</p>
<p>All the people ran out to see the new fruit-seller, and his figs
looked so tempting that plenty of people bought of him. Among the
foremost was the host of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href=
"#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>inn, with his wife and his buxom
daughter, and every one of them, as they ate the figs their noses began
to grow and grow till everyone of them had a nose fully a yard
long.</p>
<p>Then there was a hue and cry through the whole town, everyone with
his yard of nose dangling and waggling, came running out, calling,
&lsquo;Ho! Here! Wretch of a fruit-seller!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4305src" href="#xd26e4305" name="xd26e4305src">5</a></p>
<p>But our fruit-seller had had the good sense to foresee the coming
storm, and had taken care to get far out of the way of pursuit.</p>
<p>But the next day he dressed himself like a doctor, all in black,
with a long false beard, and came to the same town, where he entered
the druggist&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4314src" href=
"#xd26e4314" name="xd26e4314src">6</a> shop, and gave himself out for a
great doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You come in good season!&rsquo; said the druggist. &lsquo;A
doctor is wanted here just now, if ever one was, for to everyone almost
in the town is grown a nose<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4319src" href=
"#xd26e4319" name="xd26e4319src">7</a> so big! so big! in fact, a full
yard of nose! Anyone who could reduce these noses might make a fortune
indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s just what I excel at of all things. Let me
see some of these people,&rsquo; answered our pretended doctor.</p>
<p>The druggist looked incredulous at a real remedy turning up so very
opportunely; but at the same moment a pretty peasant girl came into the
shop to buy some medicine for her mother; that is, she would have been
pretty if it had not been for the terrible nose, which made a fright of
her. The false doctor was seized with compunction when he saw what a
fright his figs had made of this pretty girl, and he took out some figs
of the other tree and gave her to eat, and immediately her tremendous
nose grew less, and less, and less, and she was a pretty girl again. Of
course it need not be said that he did not give her the figs in their
natural state and form; he had peeled and pounded, and made them up
with other things to disguise them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p>The druggist no sooner saw this wonderful cure than he was prompt to
publish it, and there was quite a strife who should have the new doctor
the first.</p>
<p>It was the innkeeper who succeeded in being the first to possess
himself of him. &lsquo;What will you give me for the cure?&rsquo; said
the strange doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever you have the conscience to ask,&rsquo; replied the
host, panting to be rid of the monstrosity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Four thousand scudi apiece,&rsquo; replied the false doctor;
and the host, his wife, and his buxom daughter stood in a row waiting
to be cured. With the same remedy that had cured the peasant girl he
cured the host first, and next his daughter. After he had cured her he
said, &lsquo;Instead of the second premium of four thousand scudi, I
will take the hand of your daughter, if you like?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, if you wish; it&rsquo;s a very good idea,&rsquo; replied
the host.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, while I live!&rsquo; said the wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not? He&rsquo;s a very good husband!&rsquo; said the
host.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An ugly old travelling doctor, who comes no one knows whence,
to marry my daughter indeed!&rsquo; said the wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re under great obligations to his
cleverness,&rsquo; said the husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then let him be paid his price, and go about his business,
and not talk impudence!&rsquo; said the wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I choose that he <i>shall</i> marry her!&rsquo; said the
husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And <i>I</i> choose that he shan&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the
wife; &lsquo;and you&rsquo;ll find that much stronger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just then a customer came in, and the host had to go and attend upon
him, and while he was gone the wife called the servants, and bade them
turn the doctor out, and give him a good drubbing into the bargain,
saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have some other doctor to cure me!&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>So he left them, and went on curing people&rsquo;s noses all day,
till he had made a lot of money. Then he went away, but limping all the
time from the beating he had received. The next day he came back
dressed like a Turk, so that no one would have known him for the same
man, and he came back to the same inn, saying he, too, could cure
noses.</p>
<p>The mistress of the inn gave him a hearty welcome, as she was very
anxious to find another doctor who could cure her nose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My treatment is effectual, but it is rude,&rsquo; said the
pretended Turk. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ll like to
submit to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes! Anything, whatever it may be, only to be rid of this
monstrous nose,&rsquo; said the hostess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you must come into a room by yourself with me,&rsquo;
said the pretended Turk; &lsquo;and I have a stick here made out of the
root of a particular tree. I must thump you on the back with it, and in
proportion as I thump you the nose will draw in. Of course it will hurt
very much, and make you cry out, so you must tell your servants and
people outside that however much you may call they are not to come in.
For if they should come in and interrupt the cure, it would all have to
be begun over again, and all you had suffered would go for
nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the hostess gave strict orders, saying, &lsquo;I am going into
this room with the Turk to be cured by him, and however much I may call
out, or whatever I may say, mind none of you, on pain of losing your
places, open the door, or come near the room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then she took the Turk into a room apart, and shut the door. The
Turk no sooner got her alone than he made her lie with her face
downwards on a sofa, and then&mdash;whack, whack, whack!<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4376src" href="#xd26e4376" name="xd26e4376src">8</a>
he gave her such a beating that she felt the effects of it to the end
of her days.</p>
<p>Of course it was in vain she screamed and roared for help; the
servants had had their orders, and none of them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>durst approach the room. It was only when she
had fainted that the Turk left her alone and went his way.</p>
<p>But she never got her nose cured, and he married the pretty peasant
girl who was the subject of his first cure.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a chicory-seller, with a wife and a son, all
of them dying of hunger, and sleeping on the floor because they
couldn&rsquo;t afford a bed. Once when they went out in the morning to
gather chicory, the son found such a large plant of it, never was such
a plant seen, it took them an hour, working at it together, to pull it
up, and it filled two great bags. What is more, when they had got it
all up, there was a great hole in the ground. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;What can there be down in that hole?&rsquo; said the son.
&lsquo;I must go and see!&rsquo; In he jumped,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4398src" href="#xd26e4398" name="xd26e4398src">2</a> and down he
went.</p>
<p>Suddenly he found himself in the midst of a splendid palace, and a
number of obsequious servants gathered round him. They all bowed to the
ground, and said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your lordship! your lordship!&rsquo; and asked him what he
&lsquo;pleased to want.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So there he was, dressed like a clodhopper, and all these servants
dressed like princes, bowing and scraping to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do I want?&rsquo; said the lad; &lsquo;most of all, I
want a dinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Immediately they brought him a banquet of a dinner, and waited on
him all the time. Dinner over, they dressed him like a prince.</p>
<p>By-and-by there came in an ugly old hag, as ugly as a witch, who
said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Prince; are you come to marry me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m no prince; and I&rsquo;m not come to marry you most
certainly!&rsquo; replied the youth.</p>
<p>But all the servants standing round made all sorts of gesticulations
that he should say &lsquo;yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use mouthing at me,&rsquo; said the lad;
&lsquo;I shall never say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to <i>that</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But they went on making signs all round that he should say
&lsquo;yes,&rsquo; till at last they bewildered him so, that, almost
without knowing what he did, he said &lsquo;yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Directly he had said &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; there were thunder and
lightning, and thunderbolts, and meteors, and howling of wind, and
storm of hail. The youth felt in great fear; but the servants said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is all right. She you thought an old hag is indeed a
beautiful princess of eighteen, but she was under a spell; by
consenting to marry her you have ended that spell, if you can only
stand through the fear of this storm <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>for three days and
three nights, no harm can come to you, and we also shall all be set
free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The whole apartment now seemed on fire, and when that ceased for a
time, it seemed to rain fire all around.</p>
<p>For two days he managed to endure, but on the third day he got so
frightened that he ran away. He had not much bettered his condition,
however; for, if he had got away from the magic storms of the under
world, he had come into real storms in the actual world, and there he
was alone in the Campagna, starving and destitute again.</p>
<p>At last an old man appeared, who said to him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why were you so foolish as to run away? You were told no harm
could happen to you. Now you have nearly lost all. There is, however,
one remedy left. Go on to the top of that high mountain, and gather the
grass that grows there, and bring back a large bundle of it, and give
it to these people to eat, and that will finish what you have begun.
You will marry the princess, and share her kingdom; and all her people
will be set free. For all those who waited on you as servants are
noblemen of her court, who are under a spell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How am I to get up to the top of that high mountain?&rsquo;
said the youth; &lsquo;it would take me a life of weariness to arrive
there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take this divining-rod,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;and
whatever difficulty comes in your way, touch it with this wand, and it
will disappear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youth took the wand, and bent his steps towards the mountain.
There were rivers to be crossed, and steep places to be climbed, and
many perils to be encountered, but the wand overcame them all. Arrived
at the top, he saw a plat of fine, long grass growing, which he made no
doubt was the grass he had to take. But he thought within himself,
&lsquo;If this wand can do so much, it can surely give me also a house
and a dinner; and, then, why should I toil down this mountain again at
all!&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Rod! rod! give me a nice little house!&rsquo; he
commanded;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4451src" href="#xd26e4451" name=
"xd26e4451src">3</a> and there was a nice little house on the top of
the mountain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rod! rod! give me a good dinner!&rsquo; and a good dinner was
spread on the table.</p>
<p>And thus it was with everything he wanted; so he went on living on
the top of the mountain, without thinking of those he had to deliver in
the hole under the earth.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there stood the old man.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4462src" href="#xd26e4462" name="xd26e4462src">4</a> &lsquo;You
were not sent here to amuse yourself,&rsquo; said he, severely.
&lsquo;You were sent to fetch the means of delivering others;&rsquo;
and he took the wand away from him, and touched the casino, and it
disappeared, and he was once more left destitute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you would repair the past,&rsquo; said the old man, as he
went away, &lsquo;gather even now a bundle of grass and take it, and
perhaps you will be in time yet; but you will have to toil alone, for
you have forfeited the rod. And now, remember this counsel: whoever
meets you by the way and asks to buy that grass, sell it to no man, or
you are undone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As there was nothing else to be done, the youth set to work and cut
some grass, and then terrible was the way he had to walk to get down
again. Storms of fire broke continually over him, and every moment it
seemed as though he would be precipitated to the bottom.</p>
<p>As he reached the plain a traveller met him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you have some of that grass,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I was
just going up the mountain to get some. If you will give it me, and
save my journey, I will give you a prancing horse, all covered with
gold trappings studded with precious stones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But this time the youth began to pay more attention to the
injunctions laid upon him, and he shook his head, and walked on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give it me,&rsquo; continued the stranger, &lsquo;and I will
give <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>you in return for it a casino of your own in the
Campagna, where you may live all your life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the youth shook his head, and continued his way, without so much
as answering him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give it me,&rsquo; said the stranger the third time,
&lsquo;and I will give you gold enough to make you rich all your
days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the youth stood out the third temptation as well as the other
two, and then the stranger disappeared.</p>
<p>Without further hindrance he arrived at the chicory-hole, let
himself down, and gave the grass to all the people to eat, who were
half dead with waiting so long for him; and as they ate, the spell
ceased. Only as he had cut the grass in an indolent sort of way, he had
not brought so large a quantity as he ought, and there was one poor
maiden left for whose deliverance the provision sufficed not.</p>
<p>Meantime the whole face of the country was changed. The plain was
covered with flourishing cities; over the chicory-hole was a splendid
palace, where the maiden, who had under the spell looked like an old
hag, took up her abode, and where the old man had promised that he
should live with her for his reward.</p>
<p>This reward he now came to claim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you have not completed your task,&rsquo; said the
princess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I have done a pretty good deal,&rsquo; answered the
youth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there is that one who is yet undelivered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t help about <i>one</i>. She must manage the
best way she can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; said the princess. &lsquo;If you
want to have me, you must complete your work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he had to toil all the way up to the top of the mountain, and all
the way down again, and at last the work was complete. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the princess married him, and all went wondrously

<p class="first">There was once a poor chicory-seller: all
chicory-sellers are poor, but this was a very poor one, and he had a
large family of daughters and two sons. The daughters he left at home
with their mother, but the two sons he took with him to gather chicory.
While they were out gathering chicory one day, a great bird flew down
before them and dropped an egg and then flew away again. The boys
picked up the egg and brought it to their father, because there were
some figures like strange writing on it which they could not read; but
neither could the father read the strange writing, so he took the egg
to a farmer.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4532src" href="#xd26e4532"
name="xd26e4532src">2</a> The farmer read the writing, and it
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whoso eats my head, he shall be an emperor.<span class="corr"
id="xd26e4545" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Whoso eats my heart, he shall never want for
money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ho, ho!&rsquo; said the farmer to himself, &lsquo;it
won&rsquo;t do to tell the fellow this; I must manage to eat both the
head and the heart myself.&rsquo; So he said, &lsquo;The meaning of it
is that whoever eats the bird will make a very good dinner; so
to-morrow when the bird comes back, as she doubtless will to lay
another egg, have a good stick ready and knock her down; then you can
make a fire, and bake it between the stones, and I will come and eat it
with you if you like.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span></p>
<p>The poor chicory-seller thought his fortune was made when a farmer
offered to dine with him, and the hours seemed long enough till next
morning came.</p>
<p>With next morning, however, came the bird again. The chicory-seller
was ready with his stick and knocked her down, and the boys made a fire
and cooked the bird. But as they were not very apt at the trussing and
cooking, the head dropped into the fire, and the youngest boy said:
&lsquo;This will never do to serve up, all burnt as it is;&rsquo; so he
ate it. The heart also fell into the fire and got burnt, and the eldest
boy said: &lsquo;This will never do to serve up, all burnt as it
is;&rsquo; so he ate that.</p>
<p>By-and-by the farmer came, and they all sat down on a bank&mdash;the
farmer quite jovial at the idea of the immense advantage he was going
to gain, and the chicory-seller quite elated at the idea of
entertaining a farmer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bring forward the roast, boys,&rsquo; said the father; and
the boys brought the bird.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you done with the head?&rsquo; exclaimed the
farmer, the moment he saw the bird.<a id="xd26e4563" name=
"xd26e4563"></a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it got burnt, and I ate it,&rsquo; said the younger
boy.</p>
<p>The merchant ground his teeth and stamped his foot, but he dared not
say why he was so angry; so he sat silent while the chicory-seller took
out his knife<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4570src" href="#xd26e4570"
name="xd26e4570src">3</a> and cut the bird up in portions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me the piece with the heart, if I may choose,&rsquo;
said the merchant; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of birds&rsquo;
hearts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, any part you like,&rsquo; replied the
chicory-seller, nervously turning all the pieces over and over again;
&lsquo;but I can&rsquo;t find any heart. Boys, had the bird no
heart?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, papa,&rsquo; answered the elder brother, &lsquo;it had a
heart, sure enough; but it tumbled into the fire and got burnt, and so
I ate it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was no object in disguising his fury any longer, so the farmer
exclaimed testily, &lsquo;Thank you, I&rsquo;ll not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>have
any then; the head and the heart are just the only parts of a bird I
care to eat.&rsquo; And so saying he turned on his heel and went
away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look, boys, what you&rsquo;ve done! You&rsquo;ve thrown away
the best chance we ever had in our lives!&rsquo; cried the father in
despair.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4591src" href="#xd26e4591" name=
"xd26e4591src">4</a> &lsquo;After the farmer had taken dinner with us
he must have asked us to dine with him, and, as one civility always
brings another, there is no saying what it might not have led to.
However, as you have chosen to throw the chance away, you may go and
look out for yourselves. I&rsquo;ve done with you.&rsquo; And with a
sound cudgelling<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4594src" href="#xd26e4594"
name="xd26e4594src">5</a> he drove them away.</p>
<p>The two boys, left to themselves, wandered on till they came to a
stable, when they entered the yard and asked to be allowed to do some
work or other as a means of subsistence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing for you to do,&rsquo; said the landlord;
&lsquo;but, as it&rsquo;s late, you may sleep on the straw there, on
the condition that you go about your business to-morrow first
thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boys, glad to get a night&rsquo;s lodging on any condition, went
to sleep in the straw. When the elder brother woke in the morning he
found a box of sequins<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4612src" href=
"#xd26e4612" name="xd26e4612src">6</a> under his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could this have come here,&rsquo; soliloquised the boy,
&lsquo;unless the host had put it there to see if we were honest? Well,
thank God, if we&rsquo;re poor there&rsquo;s no danger of either of us
taking what doesn&rsquo;t belong to us.&rsquo; So he took the box to
the host, and said: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s your box of sequins quite
safe. You needn&rsquo;t have taken the trouble to test our honesty in
that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The host was very much surprised, but he thought the best way was to
take the money and say nothing but &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see
you&rsquo;re such good boys.&rsquo; So he gave them breakfast and some
provisions for the way.</p>
<p>Next night they found themselves still in the open <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>country and no inn near, and they were obliged
to be content to sleep on the bare ground. Next morning when they woke
the younger boy again found a box of sequins under his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only think of that host not being satisfied with trying us
once, but to come all this way after us to test our honesty again.
However, I suppose we must take it back to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they walked all the way back to the host and said:
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your box of sequins back; as we didn&rsquo;t steal
it the first time it was not likely we should take it the second
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The host was more and more astonished; but he took the money without
saying anything, only he praised the boys for being so good and gave
them a hearty meal. And they went their way, taking a new
direction.</p>
<p>The next night the younger brother said: &lsquo;Do you know
I&rsquo;ve my doubts about the host having put that box of sequins
under your head. How could he have done it out in the open country
without our seeing him? To-night I will watch, and if he doesn&rsquo;t
come, and in the morning there is another box of sequins, it will be a
sign that it is your own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did so, and next morning there was another box of sequins. So
they decided it was honestly their own, and they carried it by turns
and journeyed on. About noon they came to a great city where the
emperor was lately dead, and all the people were in great excitement
about choosing another emperor. The population was all divided in
factions, each of which had a candidate, and none would let the
candidate of the others reign. There was so much fighting and
quarrelling in the streets that the brothers got separated, and saw
each other no more.</p>
<p>At this time it happened that it was the turn of the younger brother
to be carrying the box of sequins. When the sentinels at the gate saw a
stranger coming in carrying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href=
"#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>a box they said, &lsquo;We must
see what this is,&rsquo; and they took him to the minister. When the
minister saw his box was full of sequins he said, &lsquo;This must be
our emperor.&rsquo; And all the people said, &lsquo;Yes, this is our
emperor. Long live our emperor!&rsquo; And thus the boy became an
emperor.</p>
<p>But the elder brother had entered unperceived into the town, and
went to ask hospitality in a house where was a woman with a beautiful
daughter; so they let him stay. That night also there came a box of
sequins under his head; so he went out and bought meat and fuel and all
manner of provisions, and gave them to the mother, and said,
&lsquo;Because you took me in when I was poor last night, I have
brought you all these provisions out of gratitude,&rsquo; and for the
beautiful daughter he bought silks and damasks, and ornaments of gold.
But the daughter said, &lsquo;How comes it, tell me, that you, who were
a poor footsore wayfarer last night, have now such boundless riches at
command?&rsquo; And because she was beautiful and spoke kindly to him,
he suspected no evil, but told her, saying, &lsquo;Every morning when I
wake now, I find a box of sequins under my head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how comes it,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that you find a box
of sequins under your head now, and not formerly?&rsquo; &lsquo;I do
not know,&rsquo; he answered, <span class="corr" id="xd26e4654" title=
"Not in source">&lsquo;</span>unless it be because one day when I was
out with father gathering chicory, a great bird came and dropt an egg
with some strange writing on it, which we could not read. But a farmer
read it for us; only he would not tell us what it said, but that we
should cook the bird and eat it. While we were cooking it the heart
fell into the fire and got burnt, and I ate it: and when the farmer
heard this he grew very angry. I think, therefore, the writing on the
egg said that he who ate the heart of the bird should have many
sequins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this they spent the day pleasantly together; but the daughter
put an emetic in his wine at supper, and so made him bring up the
bird&rsquo;s heart, which she kept for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>herself, and the next
morning when he woke there was no box of sequins under his head. When
he rose in the morning also the beautiful girl and her mother turned
him out of the house, and he wandered forth again.</p>
<p>At last, being weary and full of sorrow, he sat down on the ground
by the side of a stream crying. Immediately three fairies appeared to
him and asked him why he wept. And when he told them, they said to him:
&lsquo;Weep no more, for instead of the bird&rsquo;s heart we give you
this sheepskin jacket, the pockets of which will always be full of
sequins. How many soever you may take out they will always remain
full.&rsquo; Then they disappeared; but he immediately went back to the
house of the beautiful girl, taking her rich and fine presents; but she
said to him, &lsquo;How comes it that you, who had no money left when
you went away, have now the means to buy all these fine
presents?&rsquo; Then he told her of the gift of the three fairies, and
they let him sleep in the house again, but the daughter called her maid
to her and said: &lsquo;Make a sheepskin jacket exactly like that in
the stranger&rsquo;s room.&rsquo; So she made one, and they put it in
his room, and took away the one the fairies had given him, and in the
morning they drove him from the house again. Then he went and sat down
by the stream and wept again; but the fairies came and asked him why he
wept; and he told them, saying, &lsquo;Because they have driven me away
from the house where I stayed, and I have no home to go to, and this
jacket has no more sequins in the pockets.&rsquo; Then the fairies
looked at the jacket, and they said, &lsquo;This is not the jacket we
gave you; it has been changed by fraud:&rsquo; so they gave him in
place of it a wand, and they said, &lsquo;With this wand strike the
table, and whatever you may desire, be it meat or drink or clothes, or
whatsoever you may want, it shall come upon the table.&rsquo; The next
day he went back to the house of the woman and her daughter, and sat
down without saying anything, but he struck the table with his wand,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>wishing for a great banquet, and immediately it
was covered with the choicest dishes. There was no need to ask him
questions this time, for they saw in what his gift consisted, and in
the night, when he was asleep, they took his wand away. In the morning
they drove him forth out of the house, and he went back to the stream
and sat down to cry. Again the fairies appeared to him and comforted
him; but they said, &lsquo;This is the last time we may appear to you.
Here is a ring; keep it on your hand; for if you lose this gift there
is nothing more we may do for you;&rsquo; and they went away. But he
immediately returned to the house of the woman and her beautiful
daughter. They let him in, &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; they said,
&lsquo;doubtless the fairies have given him some other gift of which we
may take profit.&rsquo; And as he sat there he said, &lsquo;All the
other gifts of the fairies have I lost, but this one they have given me
now I cannot lose, because it is a ring which fits my finger, and no
one can take it from my hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And of what use is your ring?&rsquo; asked the beautiful
daughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Its use is that whatever I wish for while I have it on I
obtain directly, whatever it may be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then wish,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that we may be both
together on the top of that high mountain, and a sumptuous
<i>merenda</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e4674src" href="#xd26e4674"
name="xd26e4674src">7</a> spread out for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure!&rsquo; he replied, and he repeated her wish.
Instantly they found themselves on the top of the high mountain with a
plentiful <i>merenda</i> before them; but she had a vial of opium with
her, and while his head was turned away she poured the opium into his
wine. Presently after this he fell into a sound sleep, so sound that
there was no fear of waking him. Immediately she took the ring from his
finger and put it on her own; then she wished that she might be
replaced at home and that he might be left on the top of the mountain.
And so it was done. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153"
name="pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the morning when he woke and found himself all alone on the top
of the high mountain and his ring gone, he wept bitter tears, and felt
too weary to attempt the descent of the steep mountain side. For three
days he remained here weary and weeping, and then, becoming faint from
hunger, he took some of the herbs that grew on the mountain top for
food. As soon as he had eaten these he was turned into a
donkey,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4685src" href="#xd26e4685" name=
"xd26e4685src">8</a> but as he retained his human intelligence, he said
to himself, this herb has its uses, and he filled one of the panniers
on his back with it. Then he came down from the mountain, and when he
was at the foot of it, being hungry with the long journey, he ate of
the grass that grew there, and, behold! he was transformed back into
his natural shape; so he filled the other basket with this kind of
grass and went his way.</p>
<p>Having dressed himself like a street seller, he took the basket of
the herb which had the property of changing the eater into a donkey,
and stood under the window of the house where he had been so evil
entreated, and cried, &lsquo;Fine salad! fine salad! who will buy my
fine salad?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4690src" href=
"#xd26e4690" name="xd26e4690src">9</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;What is there so specially good about your salad?&rsquo;
asked the maid, looking out. &lsquo;My young mistress is particularly
fond of salad, so if yours is so very superfine, you had better come
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not wait to be twice told. As soon as he saw the beautiful
daughter, he said, &lsquo;This is fine salad, indeed, the finest of the
fine, all fresh gathered, and the first of its kind that ever was
sold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very likely it&rsquo;s the first of its kind that ever was
sold,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t like to buy things I
haven&rsquo;t tried; it may turn out not to be nice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, try it, try it freely; don&rsquo;t buy without
trying;&rsquo; and he picked one of the freshest and crispest
bunches.</p>
<p>She took one in her hand and bit a few blades, and no sooner had she
done so than she too became a donkey. Then he put the panniers on her
back and drove her all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href=
"#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>over the town, constantly
cudgelling her till she sank under the blows. Then one who saw him
belabour her thus, said, &lsquo;This must not be; you must come and
answer before the emperor for thus belabouring the poor brute;&rsquo;
but he refused to go unless he took the donkey with him; so they went
to the emperor and said, &lsquo;Here is one who is belabouring his
donkey till she has sunk under his blows, and he refuses to come before
the emperor to answer his cruelty unless he bring his donkey with
him.&rsquo; And the emperor made answer, &lsquo;Let him bring the beast
with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they brought him and his donkey before the emperor. When he found
himself before the emperor he said, &lsquo;All these must go away; to
the emperor alone can I tell why I belabour my donkey.&rsquo; So the
emperor commanded all the people to go to a distance while he took him
and his donkey apart. As soon as he found himself alone with the
emperor he said, &lsquo;See, it is I, thy brother!&rsquo; and he
embraced him. Then he told him all that had befallen him since they
parted. Then said the emperor to the donkey, &lsquo;Go now with him
home, and show him where thou hast laid all the things&mdash;the
bird&rsquo;s heart, the sheepskin jacket, the wand, and the ring, that
he may bring them hither; and if thou deliver them up faithfully I will
command that he give thee of that grass to eat which shall give thee
back thy natural form.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they went back to the house and fetched all the things, and the
emperor said, &lsquo;Come thou now and live with me, and give me of thy
sequins, and I will share the empire with thee.&rsquo; Thus they
reigned together.</p>
<p>But to the donkey they gave of the grass to eat, which restored her
natural form, only that her beauty was marred by the cudgelling she had
received. And she said, &lsquo;Had I not been so wilful and malicious I
had now been empress.&rsquo;</p>

&lsquo;Merenda&rsquo; is a supplementary meal taken at any time of day.
It is not exactly lunch, because the habit of taking lunch at one and
dining late has not yet obtained to any great extent in Rome; and where
it has, lunch is called &lsquo;d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner&rsquo;; breakfast
(i.e. a cup of coffee and a roll early in the morning) is always called
&lsquo;colazione.&rsquo; The established custom of Rome is dinner
(&lsquo;pranzo,&rsquo; or &lsquo;desinare,&rsquo;) at twelve, and
supper (&lsquo;cena&rsquo;) an hour or two after the Ave, varying,
therefore, according to the time of year, from six or seven till nine
or ten, and even later. &lsquo;Merenda&rsquo; is a light meal between
&lsquo;pranzo&rsquo; and &lsquo;cena&rsquo; of not altogether general
use, and chiefly on occasions of driving outside the gates to spend the
afternoon at a country villa or casino.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They say there was a duke who wandered over the world
seeking a beautiful maiden to make his wife.</p>
<p>After many years he came to an inn where was a lady, who asked him
what he sought. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156"
name="pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;I have journeyed half the earth over,&rsquo; answered the
duke, &lsquo;to find a wife to my fancy, and have not found one; and
now I go back to my native city as I came.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How sad!&rsquo; answered the lady. &lsquo;I have a daughter
who is the most beautiful maiden that ever was made; but three fairies
have taken possession of her, and locked her up in a casino in the
Campagna, and no one can get to see her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only tell me where she is,&rsquo; replied the duke,
&lsquo;and I promise you I&rsquo;ll get to see her, in spite of all the
fairies in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is useless!&rsquo; replied the lady. &lsquo;So many have
tried and failed. So will you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I!&rsquo; answered the duke. &lsquo;Tell me how they
failed, and I will do otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have told so many, and all say the same as you, and all go
to seek her, but none ever come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind! Tell it once again, and I promise you it shall be
the last time, for I will surely come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you are bent on sacrificing yourself uselessly,&rsquo;
proceeded the lady, &lsquo;this is the story. You must go to the
mountain of Russia, and at the foot of it there will meet you three
most beautiful maidens, who will come round you, and praise you, and
flatter you, and pour out all manner of blandishments, and will ask you
to go into their palace with them, and will entreat you so much that
you will not be able to resist; then you will go into their palace with
them, and they will turn you into a cat, for they are three fairies.
But, on the other hand, if you can resist only for the space of one
hour to all they will say to you, then you will have conquered, and
they will be turned into cats, and you will have free access to my
daughter to release her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will go,&rsquo; said the duke firmly; and he rose up and
went his way to the mountain of Russia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, if all these other men have failed in this same
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>attempt,&rsquo; he mused within himself as he
went along, &lsquo;it behoves me to be prudent. I know what I will do;
I will put a bandage over my eyes, and then I shan&rsquo;t see the
fairies, and their blandishments will have no power over me.&rsquo; And
so he did.</p>
<p>Then the fairies came out to him and said, &lsquo;Signor Lattanzio!
welcome, welcome! how fair you are; do take the bandage off and let us
see you; how noble you look. Do let us see your face? We are dying to
have you with us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the duke remained firm, and seemed to take no heed, though their
voices were so soft and persuasive that he longed to look at them, or
even to lift up one corner of the bandage and take a peep. But he
remained firm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Signor Lattanzio! Signor Lattanzio! Don&rsquo;t be so
ungallant,&rsquo; pursued the fairies. &lsquo;Here are we at your feet,
as it were, begging you to give us your company, and you will not so
much as speak to us, or even look at us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the duke remained firm, and seemed to take no heed, though his
head was turned by their accents, and he felt that if he could only go
with them as they wished he should want no more. But he remained
firm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Signor Lattanzio! Signor Lattanzio! Signor Lattanzio!&rsquo;
cried the three fairies disdainfully, for now they began to suspect in
right good earnest that at last one had come who was too strong for
them. &lsquo;The fact is you are afraid of us. If you are a man, show
you have no fear, and come and talk with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the duke remained firm, though a vanity, which had nearly lost
him, whispered that it would be a grander triumph to look them in the
face and yet resist them, than to conquer without having ventured to
look at them, yet prudence prevailed, and he remained firm.</p>
<p>So they went on, and the duke felt that the hour was drawing to a
close. He took out his repeater and struck it, and the hour of trial
was over. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Traitor!&rsquo; cried the three fairies, and in the same
instant they were turned into cats. Then the duke went into their
palace, and took their wand, and with it he could open the gates of the
casino where the lady&rsquo;s daughter was imprisoned.</p>
<p>When he saw her, he found her indeed fairer than the fairest; fairer
even than his conception.</p>
<p>When, therefore, with the wand he had restored all the cats that
were upon the mountain to their natural shapes as those that had failed
in their enterprise, he took her home with him to be his wife.</p>
<p class="editorial">[As this was told me, the sign by which the duke
was to recognise the three fairies was, that they were to be sweeping
the ground with their breasts. The incident seemed so extravagant, that
I omitted it in writing out the story; I mention it, however, now
because I find the same in Note 1, on an Albanian story, to p. 177, in
Ralston&rsquo;s &lsquo;Russian Folk Tales&rsquo;; I met the incident
subsequently in another Roman story.</p>
<p class="editorial">The idea which has prompted this tale is
apparently the same as that which has given rise to the story of
&lsquo;Odysseus and the Seirens.&rsquo; See Cox&rsquo;s &lsquo;Aryan

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a poor tailor starving for poverty because
he could get no work. One day there knocked at his door a
good-natured-looking old man; the tailor&rsquo;s son opened the door,
and he won the boy&rsquo;s confidence immediately, saying he was his
uncle. He also gave him a piastre<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4785src"
href="#xd26e4785" name="xd26e4785src">2</a> to buy a good dinner. When
the father came home and found him installed, and heard that he called
himself his son&rsquo;s uncle, and would, therefore, be his own
brother, he was much surprised; but as he found he was so rich and so
generous, he thought it better not to dispute his word. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>The
visitor stayed a whole month, providing all expenses so freely all the
time that everyone was delighted with him, and when at last he came to
take leave, and proposed that the tailor&rsquo;s boy should go with him
and learn some business at his expense, the son himself was all
eagerness to go, and the father, too, willingly gave his consent.</p>
<p>As soon as they had gone a good way outside the gates the stranger
said to the boy, &lsquo;It is all a dodge about my calling myself your
uncle. I am not your uncle a bit; only I want a strong daring sort of
boy to do something for me which I am too old to do myself. I am a
wizard,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4795src" href="#xd26e4795" name=
"xd26e4795src">3</a> and if you do what I tell you I will reward you
well; but if you attempt to resist or escape you may be sure you will
suffer for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me what I have to do, before we talk about resisting and
escaping,&rsquo; replied the boy; &lsquo;maybe I shan&rsquo;t mind
doing it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were walking on as they talked, and the boy observed that they
got over much more ground than by ordinary walking, and they were now
in a wild desolate country. The wizard said nothing till they reached a
spot where there was a flat stone in the ground. Here he stopped, and
as he lifted up the stone, he said, &lsquo;This is what you have to do.
I will let you down with this rope, and you must go all along through
the dark till you come to a place where is a beautiful garden. At the
gate of the garden sits a fierce dog, which will fly out at you, and
bark fearfully. I will give you some bread and cheese to throw to him,
and, while he is devouring the bread and cheese, you must pass on. Then
all manner of terrible noises will cry after you, calling you back; but
take no heed of them, and, above all, do not look back; if you look
back you are lost. As soon as you are out of sound of the voices you
will see on a stone an old lantern, take that and bring it back to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy showed no unwillingness to try his fortune, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>and
the magician gave him the bread and cheese he had promised, and let him
down by a rope. He gave him also a ring, saying, &lsquo;If anything
else should happen, after you have got the lantern, to prevent your
bringing it away, rub this ring and wish at the same time for
deliverance, and you will be delivered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy did all the wizard had told him, and something more besides;
for when he got into the garden he found the trees all covered with
beautiful fruits, which were all so many precious stones; with these he
filled his pockets till he could hardly move for the weight of them;
then he came back to the opening of the cave, and called to the wizard
to pull him up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Send up the lantern first,&rsquo; said the magician,
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll see about pulling you up afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the boy was afraid lest he should be left behind; so he refused
to send up the lantern unless the wizard hauled him up with it. This
the wizard would by no means do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! the youngster will be frightened if I shut him up in the
dark cave a bit,&rsquo; said he, and closed the stone, meaning to call
to him by-and-by to see if he had come round to a more submissive mind.
The boy, however, finding himself shut up alone in the cave, bethought
him of the ring, and rubbed it, wishing the while to be at home.
Instantly he found himself there, lantern in hand. His parents were
very much astonished at all he told them of his adventures, and, poor
as they were, were very glad to have him safe back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder what the magician wanted this ugly old lantern
for,&rsquo; said the boy to himself one day. <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4822" title="Not in source">&lsquo;</span>It must be good for
something or he would not have been so anxious to have it; let me try
rubbing it, and see if that answers as well as rubbing the ring.&rsquo;
He no sooner did so than One<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4825src" href=
"#xd26e4825" name="xd26e4825src">4</a> appeared, and asked his
pleasure. &lsquo;A table well laid for dinner!&rsquo; said the boy; and
immediately a table appeared covered with all sorts of good things,
with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>real silver spoons and forks.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4830src" href="#xd26e4830" name="xd26e4830src">5</a> Then he
called on his mother and father, and they made a good meal; after that
they lived for a month on the price of the silver which the mother took
out and pawned.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4833src" href="#xd26e4833"
name="xd26e4833src">6</a> One day she found the town all illuminated.
<span class="corr" id="xd26e4840" title=
"Not in source">&lsquo;</span>What is going on?&rsquo; she asked of the
neighbours. &lsquo;The daughter of the Sultan is going to marry the son
of the Grand Vizier, and there is a distribution of alms to the people
on the occasion; that is why they rejoice.&rsquo; Such was the
answer.</p>
<p>When she came home she told her son what she had heard. He said,
&lsquo;That will not be, because the daughter of the Sultan will have
to marry me!&rsquo; but she only laughed at him. The next day he
brought her three neat little baskets filled with the precious stones
which he had gathered in the under-ground garden, and he said,
&lsquo;These you must take to the Sultan, and say I want to marry his
daughter.&rsquo; But she was afraid and would not go; and when at last
he made her go, she stood in a corner apart behind all the people, for
there was a public audience, and came back and said she could not get
at the Sultan; but he made her go again the next two days following,
and she always did the same. The last day, however, the Sultan sent for
her, saying, &lsquo;Who is that old woman standing in the corner quite
apart? bring her to me.&rsquo; So they brought her to him all
trembling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, old woman,&rsquo; said the Sultan.
&lsquo;What have you to say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My son, who must have lost his senses, sent me to say he
wanted to marry the daughter of the Sultan,&rsquo; said the old woman,
crying for very fear; &lsquo;and he sends these baskets as a
present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the Sultan took the baskets and saw of what great value were
the contents, he said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, old woman; go back
and tell your son I will give him an answer in a month.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went back and told her son; but at the end <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>of a
week the princess was married, nevertheless, to the son of the Grand
Vizier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; said the mother, when she heard it; &lsquo;I
thought the Grand Sultan was only making game of you. Was it likely
that the daughter of the Sultan should marry a beggar,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4858src" href="#xd26e4858" name="xd26e4858src">7</a>
like you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be in too great a hurry, mother,&rsquo; replied
the lad; &lsquo;leave it to me, leave it to me.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4863src" href="#xd26e4863" name=
"xd26e4863src">8</a></p>
<p>With that he went and took out the old lantern, and rubbed it till
One appeared asking his pleasure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go to-night, at three hours of night,&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4870src" href="#xd26e4870" name="xd26e4870src">9</a>
was his reply, &lsquo;and take the daughter of the Sultan and lay her
in a poor wallet in the out-house here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At three hours of night he went into the out-house and found the
princess on the poor wallet as he had commanded. Then he laid his sabre
on the bed between them, and sat down and talked to her; but she was
too frightened to answer him. This he did three nights running. The
princess, however, went crying to her mother, and told her all that had
happened. The Sultana could not imagine how it was. &lsquo;But,&rsquo;
she said, &lsquo;something wrong there must be;&rsquo; and she went and
told the Sultan, and he, too, said it was all wrong, and that the
marriage must be annulled. Also the son of the Grand Vizier went to his
father and complained, saying, &lsquo;Every night my wife disappears
just at bed-time, and, though the door is locked, I see nothing of her
till the next morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His father too said, &lsquo;There must be something wrong,&rsquo;
and when the Sultan said the marriage must be annulled, the Grand
Vizier was quite willing. So the marriage was annulled.</p>
<p>At the end of the month, the lad made his mother go back to the
Sultan for his answer, and he gave her three other baskets of precious
stones to take with her. The Sultan, when he saw the man had so many
precious stones <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163"
name="pb163">163</a>]</span>to give away, thought he must be in truth a
prince in disguise, and he answered, &lsquo;He may come and see
us.&rsquo; He also said, &lsquo;What is his name that I may know
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And his mother said, &lsquo;His name is Cajusse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So she went home and told her son what the sultan had said. Then he
rubbed the lantern and asked for a suit to wear, all dazzling with gold
and silver, and a richly caparisoned horse, and six pages in velvet
dresses, four to ride behind, and one to go before with a purse
scattering alms to the people, and one to cry, &lsquo;Make place for
the Signor Cajusse!&rsquo; Thus he came to the sultan, and the sultan
received him well, and gave him his daughter to be his wife; but
Cajusse had brought the lantern with him, and he rubbed it, and ordered
that there should stand by the side of the sultan&rsquo;s palace a
palace a great deal handsomer, furnished with every luxury, and that
all the windows should be encrusted round with precious stones, all but
one. This was all done as he had said, and he took the princess home
with him to live there. Then he showed her all over the beautiful
palace, and showed her the windows all encrusted with gems, &lsquo;and
in this vacant one,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;we will put those in the six
baskets I sent you before the sultan consented to our marriage;
&lsquo;and they did so; but they did not suffice.</p>
<p>But the magician meantime had learnt by his incantations what had
happened, and in order to get possession of the lantern he watched till
Cajusse was gone out hunting; then he came by dressed as a pedlar of
metal work,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4891src" href="#xd26e4891" name=
"xd26e4891src">10</a> and offered to exchange old lanterns for new
ones. The princess thought to make a capital bargain by exchanging
Cajusse&rsquo;s shabby old lantern for a brand new one, and thus fell
into his snare. The magician no sooner had possession of it than he
rubbed it, and ordered that the palace and all that was in it should be
transported on to the high seas.</p>
<p>The sultan happened to look out of window just as the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>palace of Cajusse had disappeared. &lsquo;What
is this?&rsquo; he cried. And when he found the palace was really gone,
he uttered so many furious threats that the people, who loved Cajusse
well, ran out to meet him as he came home from hunting, and told him of
all that had happened, and warned him of the sultan&rsquo;s wrath.
Instead of going back to be put in prison by the sultan therefore, he
rubbed his ring and desired to be taken to the place wherever the
princess was. Instantly he found himself on a floating rock in mid
ocean, at the foot of the palace. Then he went to the gate and sounded
the horn.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4898src" href="#xd26e4898" name=
"xd26e4898src">11</a> The princess knew her husband&rsquo;s note of
sounding and ran to the window. Great was her delight when she saw that
it was really he, and she told him that there was a horrid old man who
had possession of the palace, and persecuted her every day to marry
him, saying her husband was dead. And she, to keep him at a distance,
yet without offending him lest he should kill her, had said: &lsquo;No,
I have always resolved never to marry an old man, because then if he
dies I should be left alone, and that would be too sad.&rsquo;
&lsquo;But when I say that,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;he always
says, &ldquo;You need not be afraid of that, for I shall never
die!&rdquo; so I don&rsquo;t know what to say next.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the prince said, &lsquo;Make a great feast to-night, and say
you will marry him if he tells you one thing: say it is impossible that
he should never die, for all people die some day or other; it is
impossible but that there should be some one thing or other that is
fatal to him; ask him what that one fatal thing is, and he, thinking
you want to know it that you may guard him against it, will tell; then
come and tell me what he says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The princess did all her husband had told her, and then came back
and repeated what the magician had said: &lsquo;One must go into the
wood,&rsquo; she repeated, &lsquo;where is the beast called hydra, and
cut off all his seven heads. In the head which is in the middle of the
other six, if it is split <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href=
"#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>open, will be found a leveret; if
this leveret is caught and his head split open there is a bird; if this
bird is caught and his head split open, there is in it a precious
stone. If that stone is put under my pillow I must die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prince did not wait for anything more: he rubbed the ring, and
desired to be carried to the wood where the hydra lived. Instantly he
found himself face to face with the hydra, who came forward spueing
fire. But Cajusse had also asked for a coat of mail and a mighty sword,
and with one blow he cut off the seven heads. Then he called to his
servant to take notice which was the head which was in the middle of
the other six, and the servant pointed it out. Then he said,
&lsquo;Watch when I split it open, for a leveret will jump out. Beware
lest it escapes.&rsquo; The servant stood to catch it, but it was so
swift it ran past the servant. The prince, however, was swifter than
it, and overtook it and killed it. Then he said, &lsquo;Beware when I
split open the head of the leveret. A little bird will fly out; mind
that it escapes not, for we are undone if it escapes.&rsquo; So the
servant stood ready to catch the bird, but the bird was so swift it
flew past the servant. The prince, however, was swifter than the bird,
and he overtook it and killed it, and split open its head and took out
the precious stone. Then he rubbed the ring and bid it take him back to
the princess. The princess was waiting for him at the window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here is the stone,&rsquo; said the prince; and he gave it to
her, and with it a bottle of opium. &lsquo;To-night,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;you must say you are ready to marry the wizard; make a great
feast again, and have ready some of this opium in his wine. He will
sleep heavily, and not see what you are doing; then you can put the
stone under his pillow and when he is dead call me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All this the princess did. She told the wizard that she was now
ready to do as he wished. The magician was so delighted that he ordered
a great banquet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166"
name="pb166">166</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said the princess at the banquet, &lsquo;is a
little of my father&rsquo;s choicest wine, which I had with me in the
palace when it was brought hither,&rsquo; and she poured out to him to
drink of the wine mixed with opium.</p>
<p>After this, when the wizard went to bed, he was heavy and took no
notice what she did, and thus she put the stone under his pillow. No
sooner did he, therefore, lay his head on the pillow than he gave three
terrible yells, turned himself round and round three times, and was
dead.</p>
<p>There was no need to call the prince, for he had heard the death
yells, and immediately came up. They found the lantern, after they had
hunted everywhere in vain, tied on to the magician&rsquo;s body under
all his clothes, for he had hid it there that he might never part with
it. By its power Cajusse ordered the palace to be removed back to its
place, and there they lived happily for ever afterwards. <span class=

<p class="editorial">[The introduction into this story of the dog to be
appeased with a sop, and the hydra to be slain, no trace of either
occurring in &lsquo;Aladdin&rsquo;s Lamp,&rsquo; is noticeable; the
incident of the unjewelled window loses its point, probably through
want of memory. The transporting the palace into the middle of the sea
is a novel introduction; but the most remarkable change is in the mode
of compassing the death of the magician. This episode as here described
enters into a vast number of tales. It occurs in a Hungarian one I have
in MS.:&mdash;A king directs in dying that his three sons shall go out
to learn experience by adventure before they succeed to the throne. The
first two nights of the journey the two elder brothers keep watch in
turn, while the others sleep, and each kills a dragon. The third night,
Istv&aacute;n (Stephen), the youngest, keeps watch, and is enticed away
by the cries for help of a frog, which he delivers, but when he comes
back the watch-fire is out. He has now to wander in search of fresh
fire; he sees a spark in the distance and makes for it; by the way he
meets &lsquo;Dame Midnight,&rsquo; who tells him the fire is a
week&rsquo;s journey off, so he binds her to a tree, and the same with
&lsquo;The Lady Dawn,&rsquo; so that it might not be day before his
return. In a week he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168"
name="pb168">168</a>]</span>reaches the fire, but three giants guard
it, who are laying siege to a <i>v&aacute;r</i> (fortress) to obtain
possession of three beautiful maidens, whom they destined to be the
brides of the King of the Dwarfs and of the very two dragons his
brothers had killed. But before they give him of their fire they say he
must help them in the siege. He, however, kills them by stratagem, and
makes his way into the princesses&rsquo; sleeping apartment, takes
three pledges of his having been there, and returns to his brothers.
They continue their wanderings till they come to an inn where the three
princesses and the king their father have established themselves in
disguise, and make all who pass that way tell the tale of their
adventures as a means of discovering who it was delivered them from the
giants. The princes make themselves known, and the king bestows his
daughters on them. As they drive home with their brides, they pass the
Dwarf-King in a ditch by the roadside, who implores them to deliver
him. The two elder brothers take no notice. Istv&aacute;n stops and
helps him out. The dwarf with his supernatural strength thrusts
Istv&aacute;n back into the ditch, and drives off with his bride.
Istv&aacute;n sets out to search after and recover her; he meets the
frog he delivered, who gives him supernatural aid, and leads him
through heroic adventures in which he does service to other persons and
animals, who in turn assist him by directing him to the palace of the
Dwarf-King<span class="corr" id="xd26e4929" title=
"Not in source">.</span> Here exactly the same scene occurs between
Istv&aacute;n and his bride as between Cajusse and the sultan&rsquo;s
daughter, and they lay the same plan. But the Dwarf-King is more astute
than the magician, and he at first tells her that his life&rsquo;s
safety lies in his sceptre, on which she makes him give her the
sceptre, &lsquo;that she may take care of it,&rsquo; in reality
intending to give it up to Istv&aacute;n. When he sees her so anxious
for his safety, he tells her it is not in the sceptre, but he does not
yet tell the truth; he next says it is in the royal mantle, and then in
the crown (incidents proper to the version of Hungary, which sets so
great store by the royal crown and mantle). Ultimately he confides that
it resides in a golden cockchafer, inside a golden cock, inside a
golden sheep, inside a golden stag, in the ninety-ninth <i>sziget</i>
(island). She communicates all this to Istv&aacute;n. He overcomes the
above-named series of golden animals by the aid of the animals he
lately assisted, and thus recovers his bride. <span class=

<p class="editorial">All these incidents (somewhat differently worked

imagine Caius was the right reading. Italians, though they are so fond
of clipping off the final vowel of their own words, whenever they get
hold of a foreign word ending in a consonant must needs always add a
syllable on to it. The narrator in this instance could not spell, and I
write the word as she pronounced it. Meeting with so close a
counterpart of &lsquo;Aladdin&rsquo;s Lamp,&rsquo; I cross-questioned
the narrator very closely as to whether she had not read it, but she
assured me most solemnly that her mother had told it her when she was
not more than five years old; that it was impossible she could have
read it, as she could only read very imperfectly, only a few easy
sentences; she had never in her life read anything long. I further
elicited that it was possible her mother might have read it; but I am
inclined to think she said this rather to improve my idea of her

there. &lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4971src"
href="#xd26e4971" name="xd26e4971src">3</a> asked the old woman.
&lsquo;The Master with the Apostles,&rsquo; answered Jesus Christ. The
old woman opened the door, and let them all in. &lsquo;Have you no
fire?&rsquo; asked Jesus Christ. &lsquo;No fire have I,&rsquo; answered
the old woman. Then Jesus Christ blessed the hearth, and there came a
pile of wood on it, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174"
name="pb174">174</a>]</span>and a fire was soon made. &lsquo;Have you
nothing to give us to eat?&rsquo; asked Jesus Christ. &lsquo;Nothing
worth offering you,&rsquo; answered the old woman; &lsquo;here is a
little fish&rsquo; (it was a little fish, that, not so long as my hand)
&lsquo;and some crusts of bread, which they gave me at the eating-shop
in charity just now, and that&rsquo;s all I have;&rsquo; and she set
both on the table. &lsquo;Have you no wine?&rsquo; again asked Jesus
Christ. &lsquo;Only this flask of wine and water they gave me there,
too;&rsquo; and she set it before Him.</p>
<p>Then Jesus Christ blessed all the things, and handed them round the
table, and they all dined off them, and at the end there remained just
the same as at the beginning. When they had finished, He said to the
old woman, &lsquo;This fire, with the bread, and the fish, and the
wine, will always remain to you, and never diminish as long as you
live. And now follow Me a little way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Master went on before with His Apostles, and the old woman
followed after, a little way behind. And behold, as they walked along,
all the houses of that inhospitable village fell down one after the
other, and all the inhabitants were buried under them. Only the cottage
of the old woman was left standing. When the judgment was complete,
Jesus Christ said to her, &lsquo;Now, return home.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4989src" href="#xd26e4989" name=
"xd26e4989src">4</a></p>
<p>As she turned to go, St. Peter said to her, &lsquo;Ask for the
salvation of your soul.&rsquo; And she went and asked it of Jesus
Christ, and He replied, &lsquo;Let it be granted you!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">One day as He was going into the Temple, He saw two
men quarrelling before the door: a young man and an old man. The young
man wanted to go in first, and the old man was vindicating the honour
of his grey hairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; asked Jesus Christ; and they
showed Him wherefore they strove. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175"

<p>Jesus Christ said to the young man, &lsquo;If you are desirous to go
in first, you must accept the state to which honour belongs,&rsquo; and
He touched him, and he became an old man, bowed in gait, feeble, and
grey-haired, while to the old man He gave the compensation for the
insult he had received, by investing him with the youth of the
other.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the days when Jesus Christ roamed the earth, He
found Himself one day with His disciples in the Campagna, far from
anything like home. The only shelter in sight was a cottage of wretched
aspect. Jesus Christ knocked at the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo; said a tremulous voice from within.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Master with the disciples,&rsquo; answered Jesus Christ.
The man didn&rsquo;t know what He meant; nevertheless, the tone was too
gentle to inspire fear, so he opened, and let them all in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you no fire to give us?&rsquo; asked Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m only a poor beggar. I never have any fire,&rsquo;
said the man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But these poor things,&rsquo; said Jesus Christ, &lsquo;are
stiff with cold and weariness; they must have a fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Jesus Christ stood on the hearth, and blessed it, and there
came a great blazing fire of heaped-up wood. When the beggar saw it, he
fell on his knees in astonishment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you no food to set before us?&rsquo; asked Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have one loaf of Indian corn,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5025src" href="#xd26e5025" name="xd26e5025src">5</a> which is at
your service,&rsquo; answered the beggar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One loaf is not enough,&rsquo; answered Jesus Christ;
&lsquo;have you nothing else at all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing at all about the place that can be eaten,&rsquo;
answered the beggar. &lsquo;Leastwise, I have one ewe, which is at your
service.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176"
name="pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;That will do,&rsquo; answered Jesus Christ; and he sent St.
Peter to help the man to prepare it for dressing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here is the mutton,&rsquo; said the beggar; &lsquo;but I
cannot cook it, because I have no lard.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5038src" href="#xd26e5038" name="xd26e5038src">6</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Look!&rsquo; said Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The beggar looked on the hearth, and saw everything that was
necessary ready for use.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, then, bring the wine and the bread,&rsquo; said Jesus
Christ, when the meat was nearly ready.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is the only loaf I have,&rsquo; said the beggar,
setting the polenta loaf on the table; &lsquo;but, as for wine, I never
see such a thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there none in the cellar?&rsquo; asked Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the cellar are only a dozen empty old broken wine-jars
that have been there these hundred years; they are well covered with
mould.&rsquo; Jesus Christ told St. Peter to go down and see, and when
he went down with the beggar, there was a whole ovenful of fresh-baked
bread boiling hot,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5053src" href=
"#xd26e5053" name="xd26e5053src">7</a> and beyond, in the cellar, the
jars, instead of being broken and musty, were all standing whole and
upright, and filled with excellent wine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See how you told us falsely,&rsquo; said St. Peter, to tease
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my word, it was even as I said, before you
came.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it is the Master who has done these wonderful
things,&rsquo; answered St. Peter. &lsquo;Praise Him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now the meat was cooked and ready, and they all sat down to table;
but Jesus Christ took a bowl and placed it in the midst of the table
and said, &lsquo;Let all the bones be put into this bowl;&rsquo; and
when they had finished he took the bones and threw them out of the
window, and said, &lsquo;Behold, I give you an hundred for one.&rsquo;
After that they all laid them down and slept.</p>
<p>In the morning when they opened the door to go, behold there were an
hundred sheep grazing before the door. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;These sheep are yours,&rsquo; said Jesus Christ;
&lsquo;moreover, as long as you live, neither the bread in the oven nor
the wine in the cellar shall fail;&rsquo; and He passed out and the
disciples after Him.</p>
<p>But St. Peter remained behind, and said to the man who had
entertained them, &lsquo;The Master has rewarded you generously, but He
has one greater gift yet which He will give you if you ask
Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it? tell me what is it?&rsquo; said the beggar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The salvation of your soul,&rsquo; answered <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e5076" title="Source: S">St</span>. Peter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Signore! Signore! add to all Thou hast given this further,

<p>&lsquo;Let it be granted thee,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">Another day Jesus Christ and His disciples dined at a
tavern.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5094src" href="#xd26e5094" name=
"xd26e5094src">9</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s to pay?&rsquo; said Jesus Christ, when they had
finished their meal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing at all,&rsquo; answered the host.</p>
<p>But the host had a little hunchback son, who said to him, &lsquo;I
know some have found it answer to give these people food instead of
making them pay for it; but suppose they forget to give us anything, we
shall be worse off than if we had been paid in the regular way. I will
tell you what I&rsquo;ll do now, so as to have a hold over them.
I&rsquo;ll take one of our silver spoons and put it in the bag that one
of them carries, and accuse them of stealing it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now St. Peter was a great eater, and when anything was left over
from a good meal he was wont to put it by in a bag against a day when
they had nothing. Into this bag therefore the hunchback put the silver
spoon.</p>
<p>When they had gone on a little way the young hunchback ran after
them and said to Jesus Christ,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Signore! one of these with you has stolen a spoon from
us.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;You are mistaken, friend; there is not one of them who would
do such a thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; persevered the hunchback; &lsquo;it is
<i>that</i> one who took it,&rsquo; and he pointed to St. Peter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I!!&rsquo; said St. Peter, getting very angry. &lsquo;How
dare you to say such a thing of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Jesus Christ made him a sign that he should keep silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will go back to your house and help you to look for what
you have lost, for that none of us have taken the spoon is most
certain,&rsquo; He said; and He went back with the hunchback.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is nowhere to search,&rsquo; answered the hunchback,
&lsquo;but in that man&rsquo;s bag; I know it is there, because I saw
him take it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then there&rsquo;s my bag inside out,&rsquo; said St. Peter,
as he cast the contents upon the floor. Of course the silver spoon fell
clattering upon the bricks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; said the hunchback, insolently.
&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you it was there? You said it
wasn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>St. Peter was so angry he could not trust himself to speak; but
Jesus Christ answered for him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, I said not it was not there, but that none of these had
taken it. And now we will see who it was put it there.&rsquo; With that
He motioned to them all to stand back, while He, standing in the midst
and raising his eyes to Heaven, said solemnly,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let whoso put it in the bag be turned to stone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even as He spoke the hunchback was turned into stone.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was another tavern, however, where the host was
a different sort of man, and not only <i>said</i> he would take nothing
when Jesus Christ and His disciples dined there, but really would never
take anything; nor was it that by any miracle he had received
advantages of another sort, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href=
"#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>but out of the respect and
affection he bore the Master he deemed himself sufficiently paid by the
honour of being allowed to minister to Him.</p>
<p>One day when Jesus Christ and His disciples were going away on a
journey, St. Peter went to this host and said, &lsquo;You have been
very liberal to us all this time: if you were to ask for some gift,
now, you would be sure to get it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that there is anything that I want,&rsquo;
said the host. &lsquo;I have a thriving trade, which you see not only
supplies all my wants, but leaves me the means of being liberal also; I
have no wife to provide for, and no children to leave an inheritance
to: so what should I ask for? There is one thing, to be sure, I should
like. My only amusement is playing at cards: if He would give me the
faculty of always winning, I should like that; it isn&rsquo;t that I
care for what one wins, it is that it is nice to win. Do you think I
might ask <i>that</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said St. Peter, gravely.
&lsquo;Still you might ask; He is very kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The host did ask, and Jesus Christ granted his desire. When St.
Peter saw how easily He granted it, he said, &lsquo;If I were you, I
should ask something more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what else I have to ask,&rsquo;
replied the host, &lsquo;unless it be that I have a fig-tree which
bears excellent figs, but I never can get one of them for myself; they
are always stolen before I get them. I wish He would order that whoever
goes up to steal them might get stuck to the tree till I tell him he
may come down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said St. Peter, &lsquo;it is an odd sort of
thing to ask, but you might try; He is very kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The host did ask, and Jesus Christ granted his request. When St.
Peter saw that He granted it so easily, he said, &lsquo;If I were you I
should ask something more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you really think I might?&rsquo; answered the host.
&lsquo;There is one thing I have wanted to ask all along, only I
didn&rsquo;t dare. But you encourage me, and He seems to take
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>a pleasure in giving. I have always had a great
wish to live four hundred years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is certainly a great deal to ask,&rsquo; said St. Peter,
&lsquo;but you might try; He is very kind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The host did ask, and Jesus Christ granted his petition, and then
went His way with His disciples. St. Peter remained last, and said to
the host, &lsquo;Now run after him, and ask for the salvation of your
soul.&rsquo; (&lsquo;St. Peter always told them all to ask that,&rsquo;
added the narrator in a confidential tone.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t ask anything more, I have asked so
much,&rsquo; said the host.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But that is just the best thing of all, and what He grants
the most willingly,&rsquo; insisted St. Peter. &lsquo;Really?&rsquo;
said the host; and he ran after Jesus Christ, and said, &lsquo;Lord!
who hast so largely shown me Thy bounty, grant me further the salvation
of my soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let it be granted!&rsquo; said Jesus Christ; and continued
His journey.</p>
<p>All the things the host had asked he received, and life passed away
very pleasantly, but still even four hundred years come to an end at
last, and with the end of it came Death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! is that you, Mrs. Death,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5184src" href="#xd26e5184" name="xd26e5184src">10</a> come
already?&rsquo; said the host.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s time I should come, I think; it&rsquo;s not
often I leave people in peace for four hundred years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, but don&rsquo;t be in a hurry. I have such a fancy
for the figs of that fig-tree of mine there. I wish you would just have
the kindness to go up and pluck a good provision of them to take with
me, and by that time I&rsquo;ll be ready to go with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no objection to oblige you so far,&rsquo; said
Mrs. Death; &lsquo;only you must mind and be quite ready by the time I
do come back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never fear,&rsquo; said the host; and Mrs. Death climbed up
the fig-tree. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Now stick there!&rsquo; said the host, and for all her
struggling Mrs. Death could by no means extricate herself any more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t stay here, so take off your spell; I have my
business to attend to,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So have I,&rsquo; answered the host; &lsquo;and if you want
to go about your business, you must promise me, on your honour, you
will leave me to attend to mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do it, my man! What are you asking? It&rsquo;s
more than my place is worth. Every man alive has to pass through my
hands. I can&rsquo;t let any of them off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, at all events, leave me alone another four hundred
years, and then I&rsquo;ll come with you. If you&rsquo;ll promise that,
I&rsquo;ll let you out of the fig-tree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind another four hundred years, if you so
particularly wish for them; but mind you give me your word of honour
you come then, without giving me all this trouble again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes! and here&rsquo;s my hand upon it,&rsquo; said the host,
as he handed Mrs. Death down from the fig-tree.</p>
<p>And so he went on to live another four hundred years. (&lsquo;For
you know in those times men lived to a very great age,&rsquo; was the
running gloss of the narrator.)</p>
<p>The end of the second four hundred years came too, and then Mrs.
Death appeared again. &lsquo;Remember your promise,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;and don&rsquo;t try any trick on me this time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes! I always keep my word,&rsquo; said the host, and
without more ado he went along with her.</p>
<p>As she was carrying him up to Paradise, they passed the way which
led down to Hell, and at the opening sat the Devil, receiving souls
which his ministers brought to him from all parts. He was marshalling
them into ranks, and ticketing them ready to send off in batches to the
distinct place for each.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem to have got plenty of souls there, Mr. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>Devil,&rsquo; said the host. &lsquo;Suppose we
sit down and play for them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no objection,&rsquo; said the Devil. &lsquo;Your
soul against one of these. If I win, you go with them; if you win, one
of them goes with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rsquo; said the host, and picking out a
nice-looking soul, he set him for the Devil&rsquo;s stake.</p>
<p>Of course the host won, and the nice-looking soul was passed round
to his side of the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we have another game?&rsquo; said the host, quite
cock-a-hoop.</p>
<p>The Devil hesitated for a moment, but finally he yielded. The host
picked out a soul that took his fancy, for the Devil&rsquo;s stake, and
they sat down to play again, with the same result.</p>
<p>So they went on and on till the host had won fifteen thousand souls
of the Devil. &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Death when they had got as far
as this, &lsquo;I really can&rsquo;t wait any longer. I never had to do
with anyone who took up so much time as you. Come along!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the host bowed excuses to the Devil for having had all the luck,
and went cheerfully the way Mrs. Death led, with all his fifteen
thousand souls behind him. Thus they arrived at the gate of Paradise.
There wasn&rsquo;t so much business going on there as at the other
place, and they had to ring before anyone appeared to open the
door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; said St. Peter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He of the four hundred years!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is all that rabble behind?&rsquo; asked St.
Peter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Souls that I have won of the Devil for Paradise,&rsquo;
answered the host.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that won&rsquo;t do at all, here!&rsquo; said St.
Peter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be kind enough to carry the message up to your Master,&rsquo;
responded the host.</p>
<p>St. Peter went up to Jesus Christ. &lsquo;Here is he to whom you
gave four hundred years of life,&rsquo; he said; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>&lsquo;and he has brought fifteen thousand other
souls, who have no title at all to Paradise, with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell him he may come in himself,&rsquo; said Jesus Christ,
&lsquo;but he has nothing to do to meddle with the others.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell Him to be pleased to remember that when He came to my
eating-shop I never made any difficulty how many soever He brought with
Him, and if He had brought an army I should have said nothing,&rsquo;
answered the host; and St. Peter took up that message too.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is true! that is right!&rsquo; answered Jesus Christ.
&lsquo;Let them all in! let them all in!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">When Jesus Christ was on earth, He lodged one night at
a priest&rsquo;s house, and when He went away in the morning He offered
to give His host, in reward for his hospitality, whatever he asked.
What Pret&rsquo; Olivo (for that was his host&rsquo;s name) asked for
was that he should live a hundred years, and that when Death came to
fetch him he should be able to give her what orders he pleased, and
that she must obey him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let it be granted!&rsquo; said Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>A hundred years passed away, and then, one morning early, Death
came.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pret&rsquo; Olivo! Pret<span class="corr" id="xd26e5283"
title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span> Olivo!&rsquo; cried Death,
&lsquo;are you ready? I&rsquo;m come for you at last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me say my mass first,&rsquo; said Pret&rsquo; Olivo;
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind that,&rsquo; answered Death;
&lsquo;only mind it isn&rsquo;t a long one, because I&rsquo;ve got so
many people to fetch to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A mass is a mass,&rsquo; answered Pret&rsquo; Olivo;
&lsquo;it will be neither longer nor shorter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he went out, however, he told his servant to heap up a lot of
wood on the hearth and set fire to it. Death <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>went
to sit down on a bench in the far corner of the chimney, and by-and-by
the wood blazed up and she couldn&rsquo;t get away any more. In vain
she called to the servant to come and moderate the fire. &lsquo;Master
told me to heap it up, not to moderate it,&rsquo; answered the servant;
and so there was no help. Death continued calling in desperation, and
nobody came. It was impossible with her dry bones to pass the blaze, so
there she had to stay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear! what can I do?&rsquo; she kept saying;
&lsquo;all this time everybody is stopped dying! Pret&rsquo; Olivo!
Pret&rsquo; Olivo! come here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At last Pret&rsquo; Olivo came in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean by keeping me here like this?&rsquo; said
Death; &lsquo;I told you I had so much to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you want to go, do you?&rsquo; said Pret&rsquo; Olivo,
quietly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I do. Tell some one to clear away those burning
logs, and let me out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you promise me to leave me alone for another hundred
years if I do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes; anything you like. I shall be very glad to keep
away from this place for a hundred years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he let her go, and she set off running with those long thin
legs of hers.</p>
<p>The second hundred years came to an end.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you ready, Pret&rsquo; Olivo?&rsquo; said Death one
morning, putting her head in at the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretty nearly,&rsquo; answered Pret&rsquo; Olivo.
&lsquo;Meantime, just take that basket, and gather me a couple of figs
to eat before I go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she went away he said, &lsquo;Stick to the tree&rsquo; (but not
so that she could hear it); for you remember he had power given him to
make her do what he liked. She had therefore to stick to the tree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Lady Death, are you never going to bring those
figs?&rsquo; cried Pret&rsquo; Olivo after a time. <span class=

<p>&lsquo;How can I bring them, when you know I can&rsquo;t get down
from this tree? Instead of making game of me, come and take me
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you leave me alone another hundred years if I
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes; anything you like. Only make haste and let me
go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The third hundred years came to an end, and Death appeared again.
&lsquo;Are you ready this time, Pret&rsquo; Olivo?&rsquo; she cried out
as she approached.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, this time I&rsquo;ll come with you,&rsquo; answered
Pret&rsquo; Olivo. Then he vested himself in the Church vestments, and
put a cope on, and took a pack of cards in his hand, and said to Death,
&lsquo;Now take me to the gate of Hell, for I want to play a game of
cards with the Devil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; answered Death. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going
to waste my time like that. I&rsquo;ve got orders to take you to
Paradise, and to Paradise you must go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know you&rsquo;ve got orders to obey whatever I tell
you,&rsquo; answered Pret&rsquo; Olivo; and Death knew that was true,
so she lost no more time in disputing, but took him all the way round
by the gate of Hell.</p>
<p>At the gate of Hell they knocked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; said the Devil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pret&rsquo; Olivo,&rsquo; replied Death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out with you, ugly priest!&rsquo; said the Devil.
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at you, Death, making game of me like that;
you know that&rsquo;s not the sort of ware for my
market.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5348src" href="#xd26e5348"
name="xd26e5348src">12</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Silence, and open the door, ugly Pluto!<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5353src" href="#xd26e5353" name="xd26e5353src">13</a> I&rsquo;m
not come to stay. I only want to have a game of cards with you.
Here&rsquo;s my soul for stake on my side, against the last comer on
your side,&rsquo; interposed Pret&rsquo; Olivo.</p>
<p>Pret&rsquo; Olivo won the game, and hung the soul on to his
cope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must have another game,&rsquo; said the Devil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With all my heart!&rsquo; replied Pret&rsquo; Olivo; and he
won <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>another soul. Another and another he won, and
his cope was covered all over with the souls clinging to it.</p>
<p>Meantime, Death thought it was going on rather too long, so she
looked through the keyhole, and, finding they were just beginning
another game, she cried out loudly;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use playing any more, for I&rsquo;m not going
to be bothered to carry all those souls all the way up to
Heaven&mdash;a likely matter, indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Pret&rsquo; Olivo went on playing without taking any notice of
her; and he hung them on to his beretta, till at last you could hardly
see him at all for the number of souls he had clinging to him. There
was no place for any more, so at last he stopped playing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to take all those other souls,&rsquo;
said Death when he came out; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve only got orders to take
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then take me,&rsquo; answered Pret&rsquo; Olivo.</p>
<p>Death saw that the souls were all hung on so that she could not take
him without taking all the rest; so away she went with the lot of them,
without disputing any more.</p>
<p>At last they arrived at the Gate of Paradise. St. Peter opened the
door when they knocked; but when he saw who was there he shut the door
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Make haste!&rsquo; said Death; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no time to
waste.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you waste your time in bringing up souls that were
not properly consigned to you?&rsquo; answered St. Peter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t I brought them, it was Pret&rsquo; Olivo. And
your Master charged me I was to do whatever he told me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Master! Oh, then, I&rsquo;m out of it,&rsquo; said St.
Peter. &lsquo;Only wait a minute, while I just go and ask Him whether
it is so.&rsquo; St. Peter ran to ask; and receiving an affirmative
answer, came back and opened the gate, and they all got in.

<p class="first">&lsquo;You know, of course, about St. Peter, when they
put him in the prisons here; he found a way of escaping through the
&ldquo;catacomboli,&rdquo; and just as he had got out into the open
road again he met Jesus Christ coming towards him carrying His cross.
And St. Peter asked Him what he was doing going into the
&ldquo;catacomboli.&rdquo; But Jesus Christ answered, &ldquo;I am not
going into the &lsquo;catacomboli&rsquo; to stay; I am going back by
the way you came to be crucified over again, since you refuse to die
for the flock.&rdquo; Then St. Peter turned and went all the way back,
and was crucified with his head downwards, for he said he was not
worthy to die in the same way as his Master.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">What! Never heard of Pietro Bailliardo! Surely you
must, if you ever heard anything at all. Why, everybody knows about
Pietro Bailliardo! Why, he was here and there and everywhere in Rome;
and turned everybody&rsquo;s head, and they have his books now, that
they took away from him, locked up in the Holy Office.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5435src" href="#xd26e5435" name=
"xd26e5435src">2</a></p>
<p>Pietro Bailliardo was a scholar boy, and went to school like other
boys. One day he found at a bookstall a book of divination;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5440src" href="#xd26e5440" name="xd26e5440src">3</a>
with this he was able to do whatever he would, and wherever he was,
there the Devil was in command.</p>
<p>He fell in love with a girl, and she would have nothing to do with
him; and one day afterwards they found her on Mont Cavallo with a great
fire burning round her, and everyone who passed had to stir the fire
whether he would or not.</p>
<p>Whatever he wanted he ordered to come and it came to him, and nobody
could resist him.</p>
<p>As to putting him in prison it was no manner of use. One day when
they had put him in prison he took a piece of charcoal and drew a boat
on the white prison wall, then he jumped into it, and said to all the
other prisoners, &lsquo;Get in too,&rsquo; and they got in, and he
rowed away, and next morning they were all loose about Rome. But there
was an old man asleep in a corner of the prison, and the guards came to
him and said, &lsquo;Where are all the prisoners gone?&rsquo; And he
told them about Pietro Bailliardo drawing the boat on the prison wall
with the charcoal and their all getting away in it. &lsquo;And why
didn&rsquo;t you go too?&rsquo; asked the guards. &lsquo;Because I was
asleep so comfortably I did not want to move,&rsquo; said he.
(&lsquo;But then, how did he see it all unless Pietro Bailliardo had
him put under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>a spell on purpose that he might tell the
authorities how he had defied them?&rsquo; added the narrator.)</p>
<p>Another time again they shut him up in prison, and the next morning
when they came to look for him they found nothing but an ass&rsquo;s
head in his place, which he had left there just to show his contempt
for them.</p>
<p>One day a zealous friar met him and warned him to repent.
&lsquo;What have I to repent of?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I can hear mass
better than you, for I can hear mass in three places at once.&rsquo;
Then he went away and made the Devil take him to Constantinople and
Paris to hear mass at each while all at one and the same time he was
hearing one at Rome too! Then he came and told the friar what a grand
thing he had done. But the friar told him it was worse than not hearing
mass at all to attempt to use diabolical arts in that way.</p>
<p>After that one day he was going up past the church of SS. John and
Paul<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5457src" href="#xd26e5457" name=
"xd26e5457src">4</a> when the Devil met him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the Devil, &lsquo;you have had your swing
long enough; I have come to fetch you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Pietro Bailliardo, who had set all the world at defiance all
his life, saw the Devil and heard him say he had come to fetch him, he
was seized with such terror that he began to repent, and ran inside the
church. The Devil durst not follow him thither, but waited outside
thinking he would soon be turned out.</p>
<p>But Pietro Bailliardo took up a great stone and went and kneeled
down before the crucifix and smote his bare breast with the big stone,
saying the while, &lsquo;Behold! merciful Lord, I beat my breast with
this stone till Thou bow Thy head in token that Thou forgive
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he went on beating his breast till the blood ran down, and at
last our Lord had compassion on him and bowed His head from the cross
to him, and he died there. So the Devil did not get him. <span class=

<p class="first">&lsquo;You have told me so many stories, why have you
never told me anything about Pietro Bailliardo&mdash;don&rsquo;t you
know about him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I know about him. Who in Rome doesn&rsquo;t know
about him? but I can&rsquo;t remember it all. I know he had the book of
divination, and could make the Devil do whatever he chose by its means.
And then one day, I don&rsquo;t remember by what circumstance, he was
led to do penance; but he would do it in his own way, not in the right
way, and he made a vow to the Madonna that he would pay a visit to some
shrine in Rome and to S. Giacomo di Galizia,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5477src" href="#xd26e5477" name="xd26e5477src">5</a> and to the
<i>Santa Casa di Loreto</i> all in the same night. As devils can fly
through the air at a wonderful pace he called upon a devil by his
divining book and told him what he wanted; then he got on the back of
the devil and rode away through the air and actually visited all three
in one night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But that sort of penance was no penance at all. After that he
did penance in right earnest at some church, I forget which.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it SS. John and Paul?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, to be sure; SS. John and Paul. And you knew it all the
time, and yet have been asking me!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">&lsquo;Do you want to know about Pietro Bailliardo
too?&rsquo; said the old man who had given me No. 2 of San Giovanni
<i lang="it">Bocca d&rsquo;oro</i>. &lsquo;Oh, yes; I did know a deal
about him. This is what I can remember.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pietro Bailliardo had a bond<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5499src" href="#xd26e5499" name="xd26e5499src">6</a> with the
Devil, by which he was as rich as he could be, and had whatever he
wanted; but the day came when the compact came to an end, and Pietro
Bailliardo quailed as that day approached, for he knew that after that
time the Devil could take him and he could not resist. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Before noon on that day, therefore, he set out to go to St.
Paul&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To SS. John and Paul?&rsquo; asked I, full of the former
versions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no! to the great St. Paul&rsquo;s outside the walls,
where the monks of St. Benedict are; and he waited there all day, for
before the time was out the Devil couldn&rsquo;t take him. At last
evening came on, and the chierico<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5509src"
href="#xd26e5509" name="xd26e5509src">7</a> wanted to shut the church
up; so he told Pietro Bailliardo he must go, and showed him to the
door. But when he came to the door, he found the Devil there waiting
for him dressed like a paino.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5512src" href=
"#xd26e5512" name="xd26e5512src">8</a> When he saw that, no power of
the chierico could make him go; so the chierico was obliged to call the
Father Abbot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To the Father Abbot Pietro Bailliardo told his whole story,
and the Father Abbot said, &ldquo;If that is so, come with me to the
Inquisition, and tell your story there and receive absolution.&rdquo;
Then he sent for a carriage, and said to the driver, &ldquo;Be of good
heart, for I have many relics of saints with me, and whatever strange
thing you may see or hear by the way, have no fear, it shall not harm
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Devil saw all this, and was in a great fury, for he has
no power to alter future events, and so he couldn&rsquo;t help Pietro
Bailliardo going into the church for sanctuary before the time was up.
He got a number of devils together, therefore, and made unearthly and
terrible noises all the way. But the driver had confidence in the word
of the Abbot, and drove on without heeding. Only when they got to the
bridge of St. Angelo the noise was so tremendous he got quite
bewildered; moreover the bridge heaved and rocked as though it were
going to break in twain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Fear nothing, fear nothing! Nothing will harm
you,&rdquo; said the Father Abbot; and the driver, having confidence in
his words, drove on without heeding, and they arrived safely at the
Palace of the Inquisition. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href=
"#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;The Father Abbot now delivered Pietro Bailliardo over to the
Penitentiary, to whom, moreover, he made confession of his terrible
crimes, and begged to remain to perform his penance and obtain
reconciliation with God.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But as Pietro Bailliardo had been used to follow his own
strange ways all his life, he must needs now perform his penance too in
his own strange way. Therefore he made a vow that he would perform such
a penance as man never performed before; and this penance was to visit,
all in one night, the SS. Crocifisso in the Chapel of the Holy Office,
S. Giacomo di Galizia, and the sanctuary of Cirollo. All in one
night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop! S. Giacomo di Galizia I know; we call it S. James of
Compostella; but the sanctuary of Cirollo! I never heard of that; where
is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Cirollo is all the same as if you said Loreto; the
Madonna di Loreto; it is all one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I appealed to one sitting there who, I knew, had been brought up at
Loreto.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;That is all right; Cirollo
is just a walk from Loreto. <i lang="it">Noi altri</i> when living at
Loreto often go there, but those who come from far, most often
don&rsquo;t; so we have a saying, &ldquo;Who goes to Loreto and not to
Cirollo, he sees the mother, but not the son.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e5538src" href="#xd26e5538" name="xd26e5538src">9</a> &lsquo;It
is a saying, and nothing more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Basta!</i>&rsquo; interposed the old man, who, like other
old people, was apt to forget the thread of his story if interrupted.
&lsquo;<i>Basta!</i> it doesn&rsquo;t matter: they were anyhow three
places very far apart.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5560src" href=
"#xd26e5560" name="xd26e5560src">10</a> So Pietro Bailliardo, who
couldn&rsquo;t get out of his habit of commanding the devils, called up
a number of them, and said, &ldquo;Which of all you fiends can go the
fastest?&rdquo; and the devils, accustomed to obey him, answered the
one before the other, some one way some another, each anxious to
content him: &ldquo;I, like lightning,&rdquo; said one; &ldquo;I, like
the wind,&rdquo; said another; but &ldquo;I&mdash;I can go as fast as
thought,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5578src" href="#xd26e5578"
name="xd26e5578src">11</a> said another. &ldquo;Ho! Here! <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>You
fiend. You, who can travel as fast as thought. You come here, and take
me to-night to St. James of Compostella, and to the sanctuary of
Cirollo, and bring me back here to the Chapel of the Holy Office before
morning breaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He spoke imperiously, and sprang on to the devil&rsquo;s
back, and all was done so quickly the devil had no time for thought or
hesitation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Away flew the devil, and Pietro Bailliardo on his back, all
the way to St. James of Compostella, and, whr-r-r-r all the way to the
sanctuary of Cirollo, fast, fast as thought. Then suddenly the devil
stopped midway. An idea had struck him. &ldquo;What had a devil to do
with going about visiting shrines in this way; no harm had been done to
the sacred place; not a stone had been injured;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5587src" href="#xd26e5587" name="xd26e5587src">12</a> why then
had they gone to S. Giacomo; why were they going to Cirollo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Tell me, Ser Bailliardo,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;on whose account am I sweating like this? is it for your private
account, or for my master&rsquo;s; because I only obey you so long as
you command in his name, and how can it serve him to be doing
pilgrim&rsquo;s work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Go on, ugly monster! don&rsquo;t
prate,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5594src" href="#xd26e5594"
name="xd26e5594src">13</a> answered Pietro Bailliardo, and gave him at
the same time a kick in each flank; and such was his empire over him
that the devil durst say no more, and completed the strange pilgrimage
even as he had commanded.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5597src" href=
"#xd26e5597" name="xd26e5597src">14</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus even in his penitence Pietro Bailliardo had the devils
subject to him. But after that he did penance in right good earnest,
only he chose a strange way of his own again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He knelt before the Crucifix in the Chapel of the
Inquisition, and he took a great stone and beat his breast with it and
said, &ldquo;Lord, behold my repentance; I smite my breast thus till
Thou forgive me.&rdquo; And when the blood flowed down the Lord had
compassion on him and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href=
"#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>bowed His head upon the cross and
said, &ldquo;I have forgiven thee!&rdquo;</p>

another opportunity of asking the one who was familiar with Loreto,
about Cirollo, and she explained its introduction into the story to
mean that he was not to pay a hasty visit, but a thorough one, even
though it was done so rapidly. &lsquo;Cirollo,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;is a poor village with few houses, but the church is fine, and
the Crucifix is reckoned <i>miracolosissimo</i>.&rsquo; In
Murray&rsquo;s map it is marked as Sirollo, close by the sea, without
even a pathway from Loreto, about five miles to the north; and he does
not mention the place at all in his text.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Subsequently I was talking with another who
called herself a Marchegiana, i.e. from the March of Ancona, in which
Loreto is situated, and boasted of having been born at Sinigallia, the

asked by way of beginning inquiry about Cirollo.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&lsquo;Yes; six times I have made the

something of enthusiasm. &lsquo;And you who have travelled so far, you
have been there too, of course?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;but I
mean to go one day;&rsquo; and just as I was coming to my question
about Cirollo, she added of her own accord:</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&lsquo;Mind you do, and mind when you go you
go to Sirollo too (she pronounced it Sirollo like the spelling in the

question of night flights through the air, and more, whether in the

was one of the most hotly contested questions of demonographers.
Tartarotti, lib. I. cap. viii. &sect; vi., winds up a long account of
the subject with the following:&mdash;&lsquo;&hellip; So divided was
opinion on the subject, not only of Catholics as against heterodox, but
between Catholics and Catholics, that after reading in Delrio

<p class="footnote cont">Tartarotti supplies a long list of writers
who, in the course of the sixteenth and two following centuries, took
the opposite sides on this question, and quotes from Dr. John Weir,
(Protestant) physician to the Duke of Cleves (In Apol. sec. iv. p.
582), that the Protestants were most numerous on the side which
maintained that it was an actual and corporeal and not a mental or
imaginative transaction. Cesare Cant&ugrave; has likewise given an

<p class="first">St. John of the Golden Mouth was another famous
penitent we had here in Rome. He had treated a number of young girls
shamefully, and then killed them.</p>
<p>But one day the grace of God touched him, and he went out into the
Campagna, to a solitary place, and there, with a wattle of rushes, he
made himself a hut, and lived there doing penance far, far away from
any human habitation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href=
"#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day a king, and his wife, and his sons, and his daughter all
went out to hunt. They got overtaken by a storm, and separated; some
hasted home in one direction, and some in another, but the daughter
they could not find anywhere, and when they had searched everywhere for
many days and could not find her, they gave her up for lost.</p>
<p>But she, as she was running, had seen the hut of St. John of the
Golden Mouth, and knocked at the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Begone!&rsquo; shouted the penitent, thinking it was the
Devil come to tempt him.</p>
<p>But she continued knocking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Begone! Out into the wild! nor disturb my peace, Evil
One!&rsquo; shouted he again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not the Evil One,&rsquo; answered the princess; &lsquo;I
am only a woman; I have lost my way, and crave shelter from the
storm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he heard that, he got up and let her in; but when he saw her,
he could not resist treating her as he had treated the other maidens.
Then he killed her, and threw her body into a well.</p>
<p>But the next day, when he came to think of what he had done, he said
to himself,</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is it possible that I, who have come here to do penance
for my crimes, should out here, even in my penitential hut, commit the
same crime again? I must go further from temptation, and do deeper
penance yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he left the shelter of his hut, and all his clothes, and went
into the wild country and lived with the wild beasts, and became like
one of them. After many years he grew quite accustomed to go on all
fours, and his body was all covered with hair like a lion&rsquo;s, and
he lost the use of speech.</p>
<p>Then, one day the same king went out hunting. Suddenly there was a
great cry of the dogs. They had found an animal of which the huntsmen
had never seen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>the like before. So strange was it, that they
said, we must not kill it, but must bring it to the king. With much
difficulty they whipped the dogs off, and they brought it to the king,
so like a four-footed creature had San Giovanni Bocca d&rsquo;oro
grown.</p>
<p>Neither could the king make out what kind of creature it was; so he
told the huntsmen to put a chain on it, and bring it to the palace.</p>
<p>When they got home to the palace, everyone was astonished at the
appearance of the creature the huntsmen had with them, and they called
out with such loud exclamations that the queen, who was ill in bed,
heard them, and she asked what it was about. When they told her, she
was seized with a violent desire to see the creature. But they said she
must by no means see it, being ill; but the more they opposed her wish,
the more vehement she was to see it, till, at last, the nurses said it
would do more harm to continue refusing her than to let her see it.</p>
<p>So they led the creature by the chain into her room, and placed him
by her bedside.</p>
<p>When the queen saw him, she said, &lsquo;This is no four-footed
beast, but a man, like one of you.&rsquo; And she spoke to him, and
asked him to say who he was; but he had lost the use of speech, and
could not answer her.</p>
<p>Then the baby that was lying on the pillow by her side, just born,
raised its head, and said out loud, so that all could hear, in a voice
plain and clear&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="sc">Giovanni Bocca d&rsquo;oro, God hath
forgiven thee thy sins and iniquities.</span>&rsquo;</p>
<p>The queen was yet more astonished when she heard her new-born babe
speak thus, and she asked St. John what it could mean. When she saw he
could not answer her, she ordered that they should give him pen and
paper.</p>
<p>Then, though they gave him a common pen, all he wrote appeared in
letters of shining gold, and he wrote <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>down all that I have
told you. Moreover, he bid them send to the well where he had thrown
the body of the princess, and fetch her back.</p>
<p>When they had done so, they found her whole and sound, and only a
little cicatriced wound in her throat. Then they asked her in
astonishment how she had lived in that dark, damp well all these
years.</p>
<p>But she answered, &lsquo;Every day there came to me a beautiful
Roman matron in shining apparel, and she brought me food and consoled
me, and after she had been there the well was bright, and sweet, and
perfumed.&rsquo; And they knew that it must have been the Madonna.</p>
<p>As soon as she was thus restored to her parents, and had declared
these things, San Giovanni Bocca d&rsquo;oro died in peace, for God had
forgiven him.</p>

<p class="first">&lsquo;Ah! I knew so many of those things once, but
now they are all gone, all gone.&rsquo; This was said by a fine old
man, who boasted of having the same number of years and the same name
as the Pope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dare say you can tell me something about San Giovanni Bocca
d&rsquo;oro, however,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;San Giovanni Bocca d&rsquo;oro! Of course. Everybody in Rome
knows about San Giovanni Bocca d&rsquo;oro. Do you want to know about
him? That&rsquo;s not a story; that&rsquo;s a fact.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, all you know about him I want to hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a long story&mdash;too long to
remember.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, tell me all you can recall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;San Giovanni Bocca d&rsquo;oro lived in a
village&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not in Rome, then!&rsquo; interposed I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, one of the villages about Rome; I don&rsquo;t
remember now which, if I ever knew, but about Rome of course. One day
he saw a beautiful peasant girl, and fell in love with her. But he
behaved very ill to her and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href=
"#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>never married her, and afterwards
killed her and threw her body into a well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Afterwards a great sorrow came upon him for what he had done,
and he was so ashamed of his sin that he said he would remain no more
to pollute other Christians with his presence, but went out into the
Campagna and lived like a four-footed beast; and made a vow that he
would remain with his face towards the earth<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5721src" href="#xd26e5721" name="xd26e5721src">1</a> until such
time as God should be pleased to let him know, by the mouth of a little
child, that His wrath was appeased.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many years passed, and San Giovanni continued his penance
without wearying, always on all fours.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day, the nurse of some emperor or king was out with the
little child she had charge of when a storm came on, and they ran and
lost their way. Thus running, they came upon San Giovanni in his
penance. He looked so wild and strange the nurse would have run away
from him, but the child held out its arms towards him without being at
all frightened, and, although so young that it had never spoken, cried
aloud, &ldquo;Giovanni, get up, God hath forgiven thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At this voice all the people gathered round, and they took
him back to the village; and he went straight to the well and blessed
it, and there rose out of it, all whole and fresh, the maiden whom he
had killed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he sent for pen and tablet, for he had lost the use of
speech, and wrote down all that had befallen him; and as he wrote all
the letters became gold. That is why he is called San Giovanni Bocca
d&rsquo;oro.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when he had written all these things he died in
peace.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">In another version he was living an ordinary life in
his &lsquo;villa,&rsquo; not in a penitential cell, when the
king&rsquo;s daughter lost her way at the hunt. After the crime he was
seized <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>with compunction, and went out into the
Campagna, living only on the herbs he could gather with his mouth, like
an animal, and vowing that he would never again raise his head to
Heaven till God gave him some token that He had forgiven him.</p>
<p>After eight years the king found him when out hunting, and, taking
him for some kind of beast, put him in the stables. The little prince
who was just born was taken by to the church to be baptised about this
time; and, as they carried him back past the stables, he said aloud,
&lsquo;Rise, Giovanni, for God hath forgiven thy sins.&rsquo; Every one
was very much astonished to hear him speak, and they sent for Giovanni
and asked him to explain what it meant.</p>
<p>The rest as in the other versions.</p>
<p class="editorial">[I have repeatedly come across this story, but
without any material variation from one or other of the versions
already given. It would be curious to trace how St. John
Chrysostom&rsquo;s name ever became connected with it. Though famous
for his penitential life as much as for his eloquence, and though the
four years he passed in the cells of the Antiochian cenobites were
austere enough, yet his memory is stained by no sort of crime. So far
from it, he was most carefully brought up by a widowed mother, whose
exemplary virtues are said to have occasioned the exclamation from the
Saint&rsquo;s master, &lsquo;What wonderful women have these
Christians!&rsquo;&mdash;Butler&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lives.&rsquo; There is
something like its termination in that of &lsquo;The Fiddler in
Hell.&rsquo;&mdash;Ralston&rsquo;s &lsquo;Russian Folk Tales,&rsquo;
pp. 299, 300. The years of voluntary silence, and the finding of the
silent person by a king out hunting, enter into many tales otherwise of

than these, and who never became a penitent at all. Don Giovanni he was
called. Everybody in Rome knew him by the name of Don Giovanni.</p>

called the Commendatore; and though he had the crime of murder on his
conscience he took no account of it, but swaggered about with an air of

href="#xd26e5767" name="xd26e5767src">1</a> to-night at my house, I
shall be very happy to see you at it;&rsquo; and he took off his hat
with mock gravity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will certainly come,&rsquo; replied the commendatore in a
sepulchral voice; but Don Giovanni burst out laughing.</p>
<p>In the midst of the Accademia some one knocked. &lsquo;All the
guests are arrived,&rsquo; said the servant, &lsquo;yet some one
knocks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, open!&rsquo; replied Don Giovanni, carelessly.
&lsquo;Let him in whoever it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The servant went to open, and came running back to say he could not
let the new guest in because he was only the miller, who had come in
his white coat all over flour.</p>
<p>All soon saw, however, that the guest was not the miller, though he
looked so white. For it was the white skeleton of the commendatore; and
it followed the servant into the room. Then fear seized on all and they
ran away to hide themselves; some behind the door, some behind the
curtains, and some under the table.</p>
<p>Don Giovanni stood alone in the middle of the room <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>with
his usual effrontery, and held out his hand to the skeleton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Repent thee!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5787src" href=
"#xd26e5787" name="xd26e5787src">2</a> said the White Skeleton,
solemnly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A cavalier like me doesn&rsquo;t repent like common
beggars!&rsquo; replied Don Giovanni, scornfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Repent!&rsquo; again repeated the White Skeleton, with more
awful emphasis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have something much more amusing to do!&rsquo; replied Don
Giovanni, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don Giovanni!&rsquo; cried the White Skeleton, the third time
yet more solemnly. &lsquo;Though you took away my life yet am I come to
save your soul, if I may, and therefore I say again, Repent! or beware
of what is to follow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done, old fellow! very generous of you!&rsquo; said Don
Giovanni, with a mocking laugh, and again holding out his hand.</p>
<p>They were his last words. The next minute he gave an awful yell
which might have been heard all over Rome. The White Skeleton had
disappeared, and the Devil had come in his place, and had taken Don
Giovanni by his extended hand and dragged him off.</p>

<h2 class="main"><i>THE PENANCE OF SAN GIULIANO.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&lsquo;Can you tell me the story of San Giovanni Bocca
d&rsquo;oro?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I know about San Giovanni Bocca d&rsquo;oro, that
is, I know he was a great penitent, but I couldn&rsquo;t remember
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>anything, not to tell you about him. But I know
about another great penitent. Do you know about the Penitence of San
Giuliano? <i>That</i> is a story you&rsquo;ll like if you don&rsquo;t
know it already; but it&rsquo;s not a <i>favola</i>, mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know there are seven or eight saints at least of the name
of Julian, but I don&rsquo;t know the acts of them all; so pray tell me
your story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here it is then.</p>
<p>&lsquo;San Giuliano was the only son of his parents, who lived at
Albano. In his youth he was rather wild,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5826src" href="#xd26e5826" name="xd26e5826src">1</a> and gave his
parents some anxiety; but what gave them more anxiety still on his
account was that an astrologer had predicted that when he grew up he
should kill both his parents.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;It is not only for our lives,&rdquo; said the
parents, &ldquo;that we should be concerned&mdash;that is no such great
matter; but we must put him out of the way of committing so great a
crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Therefore they gave him a horse, and his portion of money,
and told him to ride forth and make himself a home in another place. So
San Giuliano went forth; and thirty years passed, and his parents heard
no more of him. Thirty years is a long time; many things pass out of
mind in thirty years. Thus the astrologer&rsquo;s prediction passed out
of their minds; but what never passes out of the mind of a mother is
the love of her child, and the mother of San Giuliano yearned to see
him after thirty years as though he had gone away but yesterday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day when they were walking in the woods about Albano they
saw a little boy come and climb into a tree and take a bird&rsquo;s
nest; and presently, after the little boy was gone away with the nest,
the parent birds came back and fluttered all about, and uttered
piercing cries for the loss of their young.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;See!&rdquo; said San Giuliano&rsquo;s mother,
taking occasion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205"
name="pb205">205</a>]</span>by this example, &ldquo;how these
unreasoning creatures care for the loss of their young, and we live
away from our only son and are content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;By no means are we content,&rdquo; replied the
father; &ldquo;let us therefore rise now and go seek him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So they put on pilgrims&rsquo; weeds, and wandered forth to
seek their son. On and on they went till they came to a place, a city
called Galizia;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5844src" href="#xd26e5844"
name="xd26e5844src">2</a> and there, as they walk along weary, they
meet a gentle lady, who looks upon them mildly and compassionately, and
says, &ldquo;Whence do you come, poor pilgrims? what a long way you
must have travelled!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5847src" href=
"#xd26e5847" name="xd26e5847src">3</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;And they, cheered by her mode of address and sympathy, make
answer, &ldquo;We have wandered over mountains and plains. We come from
the mountain town of Albano. We go about seeking our son
Giuliano.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5860src" href="#xd26e5860"
name="xd26e5860src">4</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Giuliano!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady, &ldquo;is
the name of my husband. Just now he is out hunting, but come in with me
and receive my hospitality for love of his name.&rdquo; She took them
home and washed their feet, and refreshed them, and set food before
them, and ultimately gave them her own bed to sleep in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the Devil came to Giuliano out hunting, and tempted him
with jealous thoughts about his wife, and tormented him with all manner
of calumnious insinuations, so that his mind was filled with fury.
Coming home hunting-knife in hand, he rushed into the bedroom, and
seeing two forms in bed, without waiting to know who they were, he
plunged his knife into them, and killed them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus, without knowing it, he had killed both his father and
his mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Coming out of the room he met his wife, who came to seek him
to welcome him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;What, you here!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Who
then are those in the bed, whom I have killed?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Killed!&rdquo; replied the wife, &ldquo;they
were a pilgrim couple to whom I gave hospitality for love of you,
because they wandered seeking a son named Giuliano.&rdquo; Then
Giuliano knew what he had done, and was seized with penitence for his
hasty yielding to suspicion and anger. So stricken with sorrow was he,
he was as one dead, nor could anyone move him to speak. Then his wife
came to him and said, &ldquo;We will do penance together; we will lay
aside ease and riches, and will devote ourselves to the poor and
needy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he embraced her and said, &ldquo;It is well
spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Near where they lived was a rapid river, and no bridge, and
many were drowned in attempting to cross it, and many had a weary way
to walk to find a bridge. Said Giuliano, &ldquo;We will build a bridge
over the river.&rdquo; And many pilgrims came to Galizia who had not
where to rest. Said Giuliano, &ldquo;We will build a hospice for poor
pilgrims, where they may be received and be tended according to their
needs, till God forgives me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So they set forth, Giuliano and his wife, to go to Rome to
find workmen.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5895src" href="#xd26e5895"
name="xd26e5895src">5</a> But as they went, a troop met them, and came
round them, and said to them, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;We go to Rome,&rdquo; answered Giuliano,
&ldquo;to find workmen to build a bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;We are your men, we are your men; for we have
built many bridges ere now.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5903src"
href="#xd26e5903" name="xd26e5903src">6</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Giuliano took them back with him, and all in two days
they built the bridge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;How can this be?&rdquo; said Giuliano&rsquo;s
wife; &ldquo;here is something that is not right,&rdquo; for she was so
holy that she discerned the Evil One was in it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Be sure, Giuliano,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;there is some snare here. Take, therefore, a cheese, hard and
round, and roll it along the bridge,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5920src" href="#xd26e5920" name="xd26e5920src">7</a> and send our
dog after it; if they get across, well and good.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Giuliano, always prone to accept his wife&rsquo;s prudent
counsel, did as she bid him, and rolled the cheese along the bridge,
and sent the dog after it; and, see! no sooner were they in the middle
of the bridge than the bridge sank in; and they knew that the Devil had
built it, and that it was no bridge for Christians to go over.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then said Giuliano, &ldquo;God has not forgiven me yet. Now,
let us build the hospice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They set out, therefore, to go to Rome to find workmen to
build the hospice; and when the troop of demons came round them,
saying, &ldquo;We are your workmen, we are your workmen!&rdquo; they
paid them no heed, but went on to Rome, and fetched workmen thence, and
the hospice was built; and all the pilgrims who came they received, and
gave them hospitality, and the whole house was full of pilgrims.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, when the house was full, quite full of pilgrims, there
came an old man, and begged admission. &ldquo;Good man,&rdquo; said
Giuliano&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;it grieves my heart to say so, but there
is not a bed, nor so much as an empty corner left;&rdquo; and the old
man said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;If ye cannot receive me, it is because ye have
done so much charity to me already; therefore take this staff:&rdquo;
so he gave them his pilgrim&rsquo;s staff, and went his way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it was Jesus Christ who came in the semblance of that old
man; and when Giuliano took the staff, behold three flowers blossomed
on it, and he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;See! God has forgiven me!&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;

<h2 class="main"><i>THE PILGRIMS.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a husband and wife, who had been married two
or three years, and had no children. At last, they made a vow to S.
Giacomo di Galizia that if they only had two children, one boy and one
girl, even if no more than that, they would be so grateful that they
would go a pilgrimage to his shrine, all the way to Galizia.</p>
<p>In due time two children were born to them, a boy and a girl, who
were twins; and they were full of gladness and rejoicing, and devoted
themselves to the care of their children, but they forgot all about
their vow. When many years were passed, and the children were, it
maybe, fifteen or sixteen years old, they dreamed a dream, both husband
and wife in one night, that St. James appeared, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You made a vow to visit my shrine if you had two children.
Two children have been born to you, and you have not kept your vow;
most certainly evil will overtake you for your broken word. Behold,
time is given you; but if now you fulfil not your vow, both your
children will die.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href=
"#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the morning the wife told the dream to the husband, and the
husband told the dream to the wife, and they said to each other,
&lsquo;This is no common dream; we must look to it.&rsquo; So they
bought pilgrims&rsquo; dresses, and went to &lsquo;Galizia,&rsquo; the
husband, and wife, and the son; but concerning the daughter they said,
&lsquo;The maiden is of too tender years for this journey, let her stay
with her nurse;&rsquo; and they left her in the charge of the nurse and
the parish priest. But that priest was a bad man&mdash;for it will
happen that a priest may be bad sometimes; and, instead of leading her
right, he wanted her to do many bad things, and when she would not
listen to him, he wrote false letters to her parents about her, and
gave a report of her conduct to shock her parents. When the brother saw
these letters of the priest concerning his sister, he was indignant
with her, and, without waiting for his parents&rsquo; advice, went back
home quickly, and killed her with his dagger, and threw her body into a
ditch. But he went back to the shrine of St. James to live in
penance.</p>
<p>Not long had her body lain in the ditch when a king&rsquo;s son came
by hunting, and the dogs scented the blood of a Christian lying in the
ditch, and bayed over it till the huntsmen came and took out the body;
when they saw it was the body of a fair maiden, yet warm, they showed
it to the prince, and the prince when he saw the maiden, loved her, and
took her to a convent to be healed of her wound, and afterwards married
her; and when his father died, he was king and she became a queen.</p>
<p>But her father and mother, hearing only that her brother had killed
her and thrown her body in the ditch, and supposing she was dead, said
one to the other, &lsquo;Why should we go back home, seeing that our
daughter is dead? What have we to go home for? There is nothing but
sorrow for us there.&rsquo; So they remained at the shrine of St.
James, and built a hospice for poor pilgrims, and tended them.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p>Meantime the daughter, who had become a queen, she also had two
children, a boy and a girl, and her husband rejoiced in them and in
her. But troubled times came, and her husband had to go forth to
battle, and while she was left without him in the palace, the viceroy
came to her and wanted her to do wrong, and when she would not listen
to him, he took her two children and killed them before her eyes.
&lsquo;What do I here,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;seeing my two children
are dead?&rsquo; And she took the bodies of her children and went
forth. When she had wandered long by solitary places, she came one day
to a mountain, and at the foot of the mountain sat a dwarf,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5965src" href="#xd26e5965" name="xd26e5965src">1</a>
and the dwarf had compassion when he saw how she was worn with crying,
and he said to her, &lsquo;Go up the mountain and be consoled.&rsquo;
Thus she went up the mountain till she saw a majestic woman, with an
infant in her arms; and this was the Madonna, you must know.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5971src" href="#xd26e5971" name=
"xd26e5971src">2</a></p>
<p>When she saw a woman like herself, with a child too, for all that
she looked so bright and majestic, she was consoled; and she poured all
her story into her ear. &lsquo;And I would go to S. Giacomo di Galizia
to ask that my husband&rsquo;s love may be restored to me, for I know
the viceroy will calumniate me to him; but how can I leave these
children?&rsquo; Then the lady said, &lsquo;Leave your children with
me, and they shall be with my child, and go you to Galizia as you have
said, and be consoled.&rsquo; So she put on pilgrim&rsquo;s weeds, and
went to Galizia.</p>
<p>Meantime the king came back from battle, and the viceroy told him
evil about the queen; and his mother, who also believed the viceroy,
said, &lsquo;Did I not tell you a woman picked up is never good for
anything?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5987src" href="#xd26e5987"
name="xd26e5987src">3</a> But the king was grieved, for he had loved
the queen dearly, and he took a pilgrim&rsquo;s dress and went to
Galizia, to the shrine of S. Giacomo, to pray that she might be
forgiven. Then the viceroy, he too was seized with compunction, and,
unknown to the king, he too became a pilgrim, and went to do penance at
the same shrine. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211"
name="pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus it happened that they all met together, without knowing each
other, in the hospice that that husband and wife had built at Galizia;
and when they had paid their devotions at the shrine, and all sat
together in the hospice in the evening, all told some tale of what he
had seen and what he had heard. But there sat one who told nothing.
Then said the king to this one, &lsquo;And you, good man, why do you
tell no story?&rsquo; for he knew not that it was the queen, nor that
it was even a woman.</p>
<p>Thus appealed to, however, she rose and told a tale of how there had
been a husband and wife who had made a vow that if they had children,
they would go a pilgrimage to S. Giacomo di Galizia; &lsquo;and,&rsquo;
said she, &lsquo;they were just two people such as you might be,&rsquo;
and she pointed to the two who were founders of the hospice. And that
when they were absent, and left their daughter behind, the parish
priest calumniated her, so that her brother came back and stabbed her,
and threw her body in a ditch. &lsquo;And he was just such a young man,
strong and ardent, as you may have been,&rsquo; and she pointed to the
son of the founders. &lsquo;But that maiden was not dead,&rsquo; she
went on, &lsquo;and a king found her, and married her, and she had two
children, and lived happily with him till he went to the wars, then the
viceroy calumniated her till she ran away out of the palace; and the
viceroy was just such a one, strong and dark, as you may be,&rsquo; and
she pointed to the viceroy, who sat trembling in a corner; &lsquo;and
when the king came back, he told him evil of her; but that king was
noble and pious as you may be,&rsquo; and she pointed to the king,
&lsquo;and in his heart he believed no evil of his wife, but went to S.
Giacomo di Galizia to pray that the truth might be made
plain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, one after another they all arose, and said, &lsquo;How
comes this peasant to know all the story of my life; and who has sent
him to declare it here!&rsquo; and they were all strangely moved, and
called upon the peasant to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>tell them who had shown him these
things. But the supposed peasant answered, &lsquo;My old grandfather,
as we sat on the hearth together.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6000src" href="#xd26e6000" name="xd26e6000src">4</a> &lsquo;That
cannot be,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;for to every one of us you have
told his own life; and now you must tell us more, for we will not rest
till we have righted her who has thus suffered.&rsquo; When she found
them so earnest and so determined to do right, she said further,
&lsquo;That queen am I!&rsquo; and she took off her hood, and they knew
her, and all fell round and embraced her. Then said the king,
&lsquo;And on this viceroy, on whose account you have suffered so

<p class="first">There was a man with a general shop who had an
excellent girl for a servant, and she was so honest as well as diligent
that he left her to attend to the shop besides doing the work. All he
gave her to do she did well, and his business flourished without his
having any trouble about it.</p>
<p>But some envious people came to him and said that the girl had given
away all his substance, and there was nothing left; so he watched, and
he saw it was indeed so. To every poor person who came she gave
whatever they asked for the love of God, and all the stores and presses
were empty. Yet, as there seemed no lack of anything either, and when
customers came she always continued to supply them, he hesitated to
interfere.</p>
<p>So it might have gone on, only people went on whispering doubts. And
one said one day, &lsquo;Suppose she should die, where would you be
then?&rsquo; That is true, he thought to himself, and upon that he went
and asked her where all the things were gone. She never made any reply,
but knelt down and prayed, and as she prayed all the presses and stores
became full again with all kinds of merchandise as at the first. But
she went away from him after that, and built herself a cell, walled up
all round, next to the church of St. Anthony, where she lived in
continual prayer, and she took a brick out of the wall to make a hole
through which she heard mass. At last one day came when they saw her no
more at the hole hearing mass, and they opened her cell and found her
lying on the floor with her hands crossed on her breast, and the cell
was filled with a beautiful perfume, for she had been sanctified there,
and her soul had gone thence to God. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>St. Isidor was the steward of a rich man, and as he was filled with
holy piety and compassion, he could never turn away from any that
begged of him, but gave to all liberally; to one Indian corn meal, to
another beans, to another lentils.</p>
<p>At last men with envious tongues came to his master and said:
&lsquo;This steward of yours of whom you think so much is wasting all
your substance, and he has given away so much to the poor that there
can be nothing left in any of your barns and storehouses; you had
better look to it.&rsquo; The master, after hearing this, came down to
St. Isidor very angry, and bade him bring the keys and open all the
barns and storehouses. St. Isidor did as he was bid without an angry
word, and behold they were all so full of grain and beans, and every
species of good gift of God, that you could not go into them, they were
full to the very doors. After that the master let him give away as much
as he would.</p>

<p class="first">St. Anthony&rsquo;s father was accused of murder, and
as facts seemed against him, he was condemned to be executed.</p>
<p>St. Anthony was preaching in the pulpit as his father was taken to
the scaffold. &lsquo;Allow me to stop for a minute to take
breath,&rsquo; he said, and he made a minute&rsquo;s pause in the midst
of his discourse, and then went on again.</p>
<p>But in that minute&rsquo;s pause, though no one in church had lost
sight of him, he had gone on to the scaffold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing to that man?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has committed a murder, and is going to be
executed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has murdered no one. Bring hither the dead man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>No one knew who it was that spoke, but they felt impelled to obey
him nevertheless.</p>
<p>When the dead man&rsquo;s body was brought, St. Anthony said to
him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this the man who killed you? say!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The dead man opened his eyes and looked at the accused.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no; that&rsquo;s not the man at all!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you, where are you?&rsquo; continued St. Anthony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be in Paradise, but that there is a ground of
excommunication on me, therefore am I in Purgatory,&rsquo; answered the
dead man. Then St. Anthony put his ear down, <span class=

bid him tell him the matter of the excommunication; and, when he had

Paradise. The father of St. Anthony, too, was pronounced innocent, and
set free.</p>

CASTITRE.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I too know a story about St. Anthony.</p>
<p>St. Anthony was a fair youth, as you will always see in his
portraits. As he went about preaching there was a young woman who began
to admire him very much, and her name was Sora Castitre. Whenever she
could find out in which direction he was going she would put herself in
his way and try to speak to him. St. Anthony at first kept his eyes
fixed on the ground, and took no notice of her; then he tried to make
her desist by rebuking her, but she ceased not to follow him.</p>
<p>Then he thought to himself, with all a saint&rsquo;s compunction,
&lsquo;It is not she who is to blame, and who is worthy of rebuke, but
I, who have been the occasion of sin to her. God grant that sin be not
imputed to her through loving me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next time she met him, it was in a deserted part of the
Campagna.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Brother Antonio, come along with me down this path. No one
will see us there,&rsquo; said Sora Castitre.</p>
<p>Much to her surprise, instead of pursuing the severe tone he had
always adopted towards her, St. Anthony greeted her and smiled with a
smile which filled her with a joy different from anything she had known
before. What was more, he seemed to follow her, and she led on.</p>
<p>But as she went the way seemed quite changed. She knew well the
retired path by which she had meant to lead him, but now everything
around looked different; not one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217"
href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>landmark was the same. Yet
&lsquo;how could it be different?&rsquo; she said within herself; and
she led on.</p>
<p>What was her astonishment, when, instead of finding it terminate in
a rocky gorge as she had found before, there rose before her presently
an austere building surrounded with walls and gates!</p>
<p>St. Anthony stepped forward as they reached the gate. A nun opened
to them, and St. Anthony asked for the mother abbess. &lsquo;I have
brought you a maiden,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;whom I recommend to your
affectionate and tender care.&rsquo; The mother abbess promised to make
her her special charge, and St. Anthony went his way, first calling the
maiden aside and charging her with this one petition he would have her
make:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have sinned; have mercy on me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then St. Anthony went back to his convent and called all the
brethren together, and asked them all to pray very earnestly all
through the night, and in the morning tell him what manifestation they
had had.</p>
<p>The brethren promised to comply; and in the morning they all told
him they had seen a little spark of light shining in the darkness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It suffices not, my brethren!&rsquo; said St. Anthony;
&lsquo;continue your charity and pray on instantly this night
also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The brethren promised compliance; and in the morning they all told
him they had seen a pale streak of light stealing away towards
heaven.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It suffices not, my brethren!&rsquo; said St. Anthony;
&lsquo;of your charity pray on yet again this night also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The brethren promised compliance; and in the morning they told him
they had all seen a blaze of light, and in the midst of it a bed on
which lay a most beautiful maiden, white<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6134src" href="#xd26e6134" name="xd26e6134src">2</a> as a lily,
carried up to heaven, borne by four shining angels.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is well, my brethren!&rsquo; replied St. Anthony;
&lsquo;your prayers have rendered a soul to the celestial
quires.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p>Afterwards he went to the convent where he had left Sora Castitre,
and learnt from the mother abbess that, spending three penitential days
saying only, &lsquo;I have sinned; have mercy on me,&rsquo; she had
rendered up her soul to God in simplicity and fervour.</p>

<p class="first">St. Anthony had been sent a long way off to
preach;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6157src" href="#xd26e6157" name=
"xd26e6157src">4</a> by the way fatigue overtook him, and he found
hospitality for a few days in a monastery by the way. Later in the
evening came a Protestant<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6160src" href=
"#xd26e6160" name="xd26e6160src">5</a> and asked hospitality, and he
also was received, because you know there are many Protestants who are
very good; and, besides that, if the man needed hospitality the monks
would give it, whoever he might be.</p>
<p>The monks were all in their cells by an early hour in the evening,
but the Protestant walked up and down the corridors smoking.</p>
<p>Suddenly through the cracks and the keyhole and all round the lintel
of the door he saw a bright light issue where anon all was dark; it
seemed as if the cell was on fire. &lsquo;One of the good monks has set
fire to his bedclothes!&rsquo; he said, and looked through the keyhole.
What did he see? on the open book from which a father who was kneeling
before it had been taking his meditations <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb219" href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>stood a beautiful
Child whom it filled you with love to look at, and from Whom shone a
light too bright to bear.</p>
<p>Anxious to obtain a better view of the glorious sight the Protestant
knocked at the door; St. Anthony, for it was he, called to him to come
in; but instantly the vision vanished.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who was that Child who was talking to you?&rsquo; asked the
Protestant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Divine Infant!&rsquo; answered St. Anthony with the
greatest simplicity.</p>
<p>The next night the Protestant, curious to know if the Child would
appear again, again walked up and down the corridor smoking, keeping
his eye on the door of St. Anthony&rsquo;s cell; nor was it long before
the same sight met his eye, but this time he was led to prolong his
converse with the saint. The next night there was the same prodigy, and
that night they sat up all night talking.</p>
<p>When morning came he told the father abbot he wished to make his
adjuration and join the order, and he finally took the habit in that
monastery.</p>

<p class="first">They say there was once a poor man who had paid what
he owed for his ground. You know the way is, that when a man has
gathered in his harvest and turned a little money then he pays off what
he owes. This man paid for his ground as soon as he had made something
by his harvest, but the seller did not give him any receipt. Soon after
the owner died, and his son came to ask for the money over again.
&lsquo;But I paid your father,&rsquo; said the poor man. &lsquo;Then
show your receipt,&rsquo; said the son. &lsquo;But he didn&rsquo;t give
me one,&rsquo; answered the poor man. &lsquo;Then you must pay
me,&rsquo; insisted the new proprietor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What shall I do! what shall I do!&rsquo; exclaimed the poor
man in despair. &lsquo;St. Anthony, help me!&rsquo; He had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>hardly said the words when he saw a
friar<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6188src" href="#xd26e6188" name=
"xd26e6188src">6</a> coming towards him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, good man?&rsquo; said the friar,
&lsquo;that you are so distressed: tell me.&rsquo; And the poor man
told him all the story of his distress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I tell you how to get the receipt?&rsquo; asked the
friar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, indeed!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6197src"
href="#xd26e6197" name="xd26e6197src">7</a> exclaimed the poor man,
&lsquo;that would be the making of me; but it&rsquo;s more than you can
do&mdash;the man is dead!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind that. You do what I tell you,&rsquo; said the
monk. &lsquo;Go straight along that path;&rsquo; and the man saw that
where he pointed was a path that had never been there before.
&lsquo;Follow that path,&rsquo; said the monk, &lsquo;and you will come
to a casino with great iron gates which shut and open of themselves
continually. You must watch the moment when they are open and go boldly
in. Inside you will see a big room and a man sitting at a table writing
ceaselessly and casting accounts. That is your landlord; ask him for
the receipt and he won&rsquo;t dare withhold it now. But mind one
thing. Don&rsquo;t touch a single article in the room, whatever you
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The poor man went along the path, and found all as the monk had told
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you get here?&rsquo; exclaimed the landlord, as soon
as he recognised him; and the poor man told him how he had been sent
and why he was come. The landlord sat at his desk writing with the
greatest expedition, as if some one was whipping him on, and knitting
his brows over his sums as if they were more than his brain could
calculate; nevertheless, he took a piece of paper and wrote the
receipt, and moreover he wrote two or three lines more on another piece
of paper, which he bade him give to his son.</p>
<p>The poor man promised to deliver it, and turned to go; but as he
went could not forbear putting his hand over the polished surface of a
table he had to pass, unmindful of the charge the monk had given him
not to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>touch anything. His hand was no sooner in
contact with the table than the whole skin was burnt off, and he
understood that he was in Hell. With all expedition he watched the turn
of the door opening, and hastened out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you got about your hand?&rsquo; asked St. Anthony
when the man came back, for the friar was none other than St.
Anthony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I touched one of the tables in that house,&rsquo; he
answered, &lsquo;forgetting what you told me, and burnt my hand so
badly I had to dip this cloth in a river as I came by and tie it up.
But I have the receipt, thanks to you.&rsquo; So St. Anthony touched
his hand and healed it, and he saw him no more.</p>
<p>Then the man took the letter to the old lord&rsquo;s son.
&lsquo;Why, this is my father&rsquo;s writing!&rsquo; he exclaimed;
&lsquo;and my father is dead. How did you come by it?&rsquo; And he
told him. And the letter said: &lsquo;Behold, I am in Hell! But you,
mend your ways; give money to the poor; compensate this man for the
trouble he has had; and be just to all, lest you also come
hither.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the old landlord&rsquo;s son gave the man a large sum of money
to compensate him for his anxieties, and sent him away consoled.

"xd26e6226src" href="#xd26e6226" name="xd26e6226src">1</a> and gave her
work she was unequal to do.</p>
<p>One day her stepmother had sent her out to tie up bundles of hay. As
she was so engaged a Count came by, and he stopped to look at her, for
she was rarely beautiful.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6231src" href=
"#xd26e6231" name="xd26e6231src">2</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;What hard work for such pretty little hands,&rsquo; he began
by saying; and after many tender words had been exchanged he proposed
that she should go home with him, where her life would be the reverse
of the suffering existence she had now to endure.</p>
<p>Margaret consented at once, for her stepmother, besides working her
hard, had neglected to form her to proper sentiments of virtue.</p>
<p>The count took her to his villa at a place called Monte Porciana, a
good way from Cortona. Here her life was indeed a contrast to what it
had been at home at Cortona. Instead of having to work, she had plenty
of servants to wait upon her; her dress and her food were all in the
greatest luxury, and she was supplied with everything she wished for.
Sometimes as she went to the theatre, decked out in her gay attire, and
knowing that she was a scandal to all, she would say in mirth and
wantonness, &lsquo;Who knows whether one day I may not be stuck up
there on high in the churches, like some of those saints? As strange
things have happened ere now!&rsquo; But she only said it in
wantonness. So she went on enjoying life, and when their son was born
there was nothing more she desired.</p>
<p>In the midst of this gay existence, word was brought her one evening
that the Count, who had gone out that morning full of health and
spirits to the hunt, had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223"
href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>overtaken and assassinated,
and as all had been afraid to pursue the murderers, they knew not where
his body was.</p>
<p>Margaret was thrown into a frenzy<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6246src" href="#xd26e6246" name="xd26e6246src">3</a> at the news;
her fine clothing and her rich fare gave her little pleasure now. All
amusement and frivolity were put out of sight; and she sat on her sofa
and stared before her, for she had no heart to turn to anything that
could distract her thoughts from her great loss. Then one day&mdash;it
might have been three days after&mdash;a favourite dog belonging to the
count came limping and whining up to her. Margaret rose immediately;
she knew that the dog would take her to the count&rsquo;s body, and she
rose up and motioned to him to go: and the dog, all glad to return to
his master, ran on before. All the household were too much afraid of
the assassins to venture in their way, so Margaret went forth alone. It
was a long rough way; but the dog ran on, and Margaret kept on as well
as her broken strength would admit. At last they came to a brake where
the dog stopped, and now whined no longer but howled piteously.</p>
<p>Margaret knew that they had reached the object of their search, and
it was indeed here the assassins had hidden the body. Moving away with
her own hands the leaves and branches with which they had covered it
over, the fearful sight of her lover&rsquo;s mangled body lay before
her. The condition into which the wounds and the lapse of time had
brought it was more than she could bear to look at, and she swooned
away on the spot.</p>
<p>When she came to herself all the course of her thoughts was changed.
She saw what her life had been; the sense of the scandal she had given
was more to her even than her own distracting grief. As the most
terrible penance she could think of, she resolved to go back to her
stepmother and endure her hard treatment, sharpened by the invectives
with which she knew it would now be seasoned. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p>Taking with her her son, she went to her, therefore, and with the
greatest submission of manner entreated to be readmitted. But not even
this would the stepmother grant her, but drove her away from the door.
She then turned to her father, but he was bound to say the same as his
wife. She now saw there was one misery worse than harsh treatment, and
that was penury&mdash;starvation, not only for herself, but her
child.</p>
<p>Little she cared what became of her, but for the child something
must be done. What did she do? She went and put on a sackcloth
dress,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6259src" href="#xd26e6259" name=
"xd26e6259src">4</a> tied about the waist with a rope, and she went to
the church at the high mass time; and when mass was over she stood on
the altar step, and told all the people she was Margaret of Cortona,
who had given so much scandal, and now was come to show her contrition
for it.</p>
<p>Her sufferings had gone up before God. As she spoke her confession
so humbly before all the people, the count&rsquo;s mother rose from her
seat, and, coming up to her, threw her handkerchief over her
head<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6267src" href="#xd26e6267" name=
"xd26e6267src">5</a>&mdash;for she was bareheaded&mdash;and led her
away to her home.</p>
<p>She would only accept her hospitality on condition of being allowed
to live in a little room apart, with no more furniture than a
nun&rsquo;s cell. Here she lived twelve years of penance, till her boy
was old enough to choose his state in life. He elected to be a
Dominican, and afterwards became a Preacher of the Apostolic Palace;
and she entered a Franciscan convent, where she spent ten more years of
penance, till God took her to Himself.</p>
<p>She cut off all her long hair when she went to live in her cell at
the house of the count&rsquo;s mother, that she might not again be an
occasion of sin to anyone. And after that, when she found she was still
a subject of human admiration, she cut off her lips, that no one might
admire her again.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6274src" href="#xd26e6274"

is thus given in Butler:&mdash;&lsquo;Margaret was a native of Alviano
in Tuscany. The harshness of a stepmother and her own indulged
propension to vice cast her headlong into the greatest disorders. The
sight of the carcase of a man, half-putrefied, who had been her
gallant, struck her with so great a fear of the Divine judgments, and
with so deep a sense of the treachery of the world, that she in a
moment became a perfect penitent. The first thing she did was to throw
herself at her father&rsquo;s feet, bathed in tears, to beg his pardon
for her contempt of his authority and fatherly admonitions. She spent
the days and nights in tears; and to repair the scandal she had given
by her crimes, she went to the parish church of Alviano with a rope
about her neck, and there asked public pardon for them. After this she
repaired to Cortona and made her most penitent confession to a father
of the Order of S. Francis, who admired the great sentiments of
compunction with which she was filled, and prescribed her austerities
and practices suitable to her fervour. Her conversion happened in the
year 1274, the twenty-fifth of her age&#8202;&hellip;. This model of
true penitents, after twenty-three years spent in severe penance,
twenty of them in the religious habit, being worn out by austerities
and consumed by the fire of divine love, died on the 22nd of February
1297.&rsquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<h2 class="main"><i>ST. THEODORA.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Santa Teodora was young she was married, and
lived very happily with her husband, for they were both very fond of
each other.</p>
<p>But there was a count who saw her and fell in love with her, and
tried his utmost to get an opportunity of telling her his affection,
but she was so prudent that he could not approach her. So what did he
do? he went to a bad old woman<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6286src"
href="#xd26e6286" name="xd26e6286src">1</a> and told her that he would
give her ever so much money if she would get him the opportunity of
meeting her. The old wretch accepted <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>the commission
willingly, and put all her bad arts in requisition to make Theodora
forget her duty. For a long time Theodora refused to listen to her and
sent her away, but she went on finding excuses to come to her, and
again and again urged her persuasions and excited her curiosity so that
finally she consented that he might just come and see her, and the
witch woman assured her that was all he asked. But what he wanted was
the opportunity of speaking his own story into her ear, and when that
was given him he pushed his suit so successfully that it wasn&rsquo;t
only once he came, but many times.</p>
<p>Yet it was not a very long time before a day came when Theodora saw
how wrong she had been, and then, seized with compunction, she
determined to go away and hide herself where she would never be heard
of more. Before her husband came home she cut off all her hair, and
putting on a coarse dress she went to a Capuchin monastery and asked
admission.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is your name?&rsquo; asked the Superior.</p>
<p>&lsquo;T<i>h</i>eodor<i>e</i>,&rsquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem too young for our severe rule,&rsquo; he continued;
&lsquo;you seem a mere boy;&rsquo; but she expressed such sincere
sentiments of contrition as showed him she was worthy to embrace their
life of penance.</p>
<p>The Devil was very much vexed to see what a perfect penitent she
made, and he stirred up the other monks to suspect her of all manner of
things; but they could find no fault against her, nor did they ever
suspect that she was a woman.</p>
<p>One day when she was sent with another brother to beg for the
convent a storm overtook them in a wood, and they were obliged to seek
the shelter of a cottage there was on the borders of the wood where
they were belated. &lsquo;There is room in the stable for one of
you,&rsquo; said the peasant who lived there; &lsquo;but that other one
who looks so young and so delicate&rsquo; (he meant Theodora)
&lsquo;must sleep <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227"
name="pb227">227</a>]</span>indoors, and the only place is the loft
where my daughter sleeps; but it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rsquo;
Theodora, therefore, slept in the loft and the monk in the stable, and
in the morning when the weather was fair they went back to their
convent. Months passed away, and the incident was almost forgotten,
when one day the peasant came to the monastery and rang the bell in a
great fury, and he laid down at the entrance a bundle in which was a
baby. &lsquo;That young monk of yours is the father of this
child,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and you ought to turn him out of the
convent.&rsquo; Then the Superior sent for &lsquo;Theodore,&rsquo; and
repeated what the peasant had said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely God has sent me this new penance because the life I
lead here is not severe enough,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;He has sent me
this further punishment that all the community should think me
guilty.&rsquo; Therefore she would not justify herself, but accepted
the accusation and took the baby and went away. Her only way of living
now was to get a night&rsquo;s lodging how she could, and come every
day to the convent gate with the child and live on the dole that was
distributed there to the poor. What a life for her who had been brought
up delicately in her own palace!</p>
<p>She was not allowed to rest, however, even so, for people took
offence because she was permitted to remain so near the monastery, and
the monks had to send her away. So she went to seek the shelter of a
wood, and to labour to find the means of living for herself and the
child in the roots and herbs she could pick up. But one of the monks
one day found her there, and saw her so emaciated that he told the
Superior, and he let her come back to receive the dole.</p>
<p>At last she died, and when they came to bury her they found she had
in one hand a written paper so tightly clasped that no one had the
strength to unclose it; and there she lay on her bier in the church
looking so sad and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228"
name="pb228">228</a>]</span>worn, yet as sweetly fair as she had looked
in life, and with the written paper tightly grasped in her closed
hand.</p>
<p>Now when her husband found that she had left his palace the night
she went away he left no means untried to discover where she was; and
when he had made inquiries and sent everywhere, and could learn no
tidings whatever, he put on pilgrim&rsquo;s weeds and went out to seek
for her everywhere himself.</p>
<p>It so happened that he came into the city where she died just as she
was thus laid on her bier in the church. In spite of her male attire he
knew her; in the midst of his grief he noticed the written paper she
held. To <i>his</i> touch her hand opened instantly, and in the scroll
was found recorded all she had done and all she had suffered.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Nun Beatrice had not altogether the true spirit of a
religious: she was somewhat given to vanity;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6343src" href="#xd26e6343" name="xd26e6343src">2</a> though but
for this she was a good nun, and full of excellent dispositions. She
held the office of portress;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6346src" href=
"#xd26e6346" name="xd26e6346src">3</a> and, as she determined to go
away out of her convent and return into the world, this seemed to
afford her a favourable opportunity for carrying out her design.
Accordingly, one day when the house was very quiet, and there seemed no
danger of being observed, having previously contrived to secrete some
secular clothes such as passed through her hands to keep in store for
giving to the poor, she let herself out and went away.</p>
<p>In the parlour was a kneeling-desk with a picture of Our Lady
hanging over it, where she had been wont to kneel and hold converse
with Our Lady in prayer whenever she had a moment to spare. On this
desk she laid <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>the keys before she went, thinking it was a safe
place for the Superior to find them; and she commended them to the care
of Our Lady, whose picture hung above, and said, &lsquo;Keep thou the
keys, and let no harm come to this good house and my dear
sisters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she said the words Our Lady looked at her with a glance of
reproach, enough to have melted her heart and made her return to a
better mood had she seen it; but she was too full of her own thoughts
and the excitement of her undertaking to notice anything. No sooner was
she gone out, however, than Our Lady, walking out of the canvas,
assumed the dress that she had laid aside, and, tying the keys to her
girdle, assumed the office of portress.</p>
<p>With the habit of the portress Our Lady also assumed her semblance;
so that no one noticed the exchange, except that all remarked how
humble, how modest, how edifying Beatrice had become.</p>
<p>After a time the nuns began to say it was a pity so perfect a nun
should be left in so subordinate a position, and they made her
therefore Mistress of the Novices. This office she exercised with as
great perfection, according to its requirements, as she had the other;
and so sweetly did she train the young nuns entrusted to her direction
that all the novices became saints.</p>
<p>Beatrice meantime had gone to live in the world as a secular; and
though she often repented of what she had done, she had not the courage
to go back and tell all. She prayed for courage, but she went on
delaying. While she was in this mind it so happened one day that the
factor<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6361src" href="#xd26e6361" name=
"xd26e6361src">4</a> of the convent came to the house where she was
living. What strange and moving memories of her peaceful home filled
her mind as she saw his well-known form, though he did not recognise
her in her secular dress! What an opportunity too, she thought, to
learn what was the feeling of the community towards her, and what had
been said of her escape! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href=
"#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope all your nuns are well,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I used
to live in their neighbourhood once, and there was one of them I used
to know, Suora<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6367src" href="#xd26e6367"
name="xd26e6367src">5</a> Beatrice. How is she now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sister Beatrice!&rsquo; said the factor. &lsquo;She is the
model of perfection, the example of the whole house. Everybody is ready
to worship her. With all respect to the Church, which never canonizes
the living, no one doubts she is a saint indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cannot be the same,&rsquo; answered Beatrice. &lsquo;The
one I knew was anything but a saint, though I loved her well, and
should like to have news of her.&rsquo; And she hardly knew how to
conceal the astonishment with which she was seized at hearing him speak
thus; for the event on which she expected him to enlarge at once was
the extraordinary fact of her escape. But he pursued in the same quiet
way as before. &lsquo;Oh yes, it must be the same. There has never been
but one of the name since I have known the convent. She was portress
some time ago; but latterly she has been made Mistress of the
Novices.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing more to be learnt from him; so she pursued her
inquiries no further. But he had no sooner had start enough to put him
at a safe distance, than she set out to go to the convent and see this
Sister Beatrice who so strangely represented her.</p>
<p>Arrived at the convent door, she asked to see Sister Beatrice, and
in a very few minutes the Mistress of the Novices entered the
parlour.</p>
<p>The presence of the new Mistress of the Novices filled Beatrice with
an awe she could not account for; and, without waiting to ask herself
why, she fell on her knees before her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is well you have come back, my child,&rsquo; said Our
Lady; &lsquo;resume your dress, which I have worn for you; go in to the
convent again, and do penance, and keep up the good name I have earned
for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that Our Lady returned to the canvas; Beatrice <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>resumed her habit, and strove so earnestly to
form herself by the model of perfection Our Lady had set while wearing
it, that in a few months she became a saint.</p>

<p class="first">There was a cardinal&mdash;Gastaldi was his
name&mdash;who went a good deal into society to the neglect of more
important duties. One evening, when he was at a conversazione, Padre
Filippo came to the house where he was and had him called out to him in
an empty room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your Eminence! come to this window, I have something to show
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Cardinal came to the window and looked out, and instead of the
houses he saw Hell opened and all the souls<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6442src" href="#xd26e6442" name="xd26e6442src">3</a> in the
flames; a great serpent was wriggling in and out among them and biting
them, and in the midst was a gilt cardinalitial chair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is that seat for?&rsquo; inquired the Cardinal.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;It is placed there for your Eminence,&rsquo; replied St.
Philip.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What must I do to escape it?&rsquo; exclaimed the Cardinal,
horrified and self-convicted.</p>
<p>Padre Filippo read him a lecture on penitence and amendment of life,
and for the practical part of his advice warned him to devote to good
works moneys he had been too fond of heaping up. The Cardinal after
this became very devout, and the poor were great gainers by St.
Philip&rsquo;s instructions to him, and the two churches you see at the
end of the Corso and Babbuino in Piazza del Popolo were also built by
him with the money Padre Filippo had warned him to spend aright, and
you may see his arms up there any day for yourself.<a class="noteref"

<p class="first">Some of their stories of him are jocose. There was a
young married lady who was a friend of the Order, and had done it much
good. She was very much afraid of the idea of her confinement as the
time approached and said she could never endure it. Padre Filippo knew
how good she was and felt great compassion for her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, my child,&rsquo; said the &lsquo;good
Philip&rsquo;; &lsquo;I will take all your pain on myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Time passed away, and one night the community was very much
surprised to hear &lsquo;good Philip&rsquo; raving and shouting with
pain; he who voluntarily submitted to every penance without a word, and
whom they had often seen so patient in illness. That same night the
lady&rsquo;s child was born and she felt no pain at all.</p>
<p>Early next morning she sent to tell him that her child was born, and
to ask how he was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell her I am getting a little better now,&rsquo; said
&lsquo;good Philip,&rsquo; &lsquo;but I never suffered anything like it
before. Next time, mind, she must manage her affairs for herself. For
never will <i>I</i> interfere<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6478src" href=

<p class="first">Another who had no child was very anxious to have one,
and came to Padre Filippo to ask him to pray for her that she might
have one. Padre Filippo promised to pray for her; but instead of a
child there was only a shapeless thing. She sent for Padre Filippo once
more, therefore, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There! that&rsquo;s all your prayers have brought!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh never mind!&rsquo; said Padre Filippo; and he took it and
shaped it (the narrator twisted up a large towel and showed how he
formed first one leg then the other, then the arms, then the head, as
if she had seen him do it). Then he knelt down by the side and prayed
while he told them to keep silence, and it opened its eyes and cried,
and the mother was content.</p>

his penitents afford an endless theme of anecdote, but some have grown

<p class="first">There was a man who was dying, and would not have a
priest near him. He said he had so many sins on him it was impossible
God could forgive him, so it was no use bothering himself about
confessing. His wife and his children begged and entreated him to let
them send for a priest, but he would not listen to them.</p>
<p>So they sent for Padre Filippo, and as he was a friend he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;If he comes as a visitor he may come in, but not as a
priest.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=

<p>Good Philip sat down by his side and said:</p>

as a priest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sick man gave the same answer as before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now you&rsquo;re quite mistaken,&rsquo; said St. Philip,
&lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll show you something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he called for paper and pen and wrote a note.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Padre Eterne!&rsquo; he wrote. &lsquo;Can a man&rsquo;s sins
be forgiven?&rsquo; and he folded it, and away it went of itself right
up to heaven.</p>
<p>An hour later, as they were all sitting there, another note came
back all by itself, written in shining letters of gold, and it
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Padre Eterne forgives and receives everyone who is
penitent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sick man resisted no longer after that; he made his confession

<p class="first">Padre Filippo was walking one day through the streets
of Rome when he saw a great crowd very much excited.
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; asked &lsquo;good
Philip.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a man in that house up there beating his wife
fit to kill her, and for nothing at all, for she&rsquo;s an angel of
goodness. Nothing at all, but because she&rsquo;s so ugly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Padre Filippo waited till the husband was tired of beating her and
had gone out, and all the crowd had dispersed. Then he went up to the
room where the poor woman lived, and knocked at the door.
&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; said the woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Padre Filippo!&rsquo; answered &lsquo;good Philip,&rsquo; and
the woman opened quickly enough when she heard it was Padre Filippo who
knocked.</p>
<p>But good Philip himself started back with horror when he saw her,
she was so ugly. However, he said nothing, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>but
made the sign of the cross over her, and prayed, and immediately she
became as beautiful as she had been ugly; but she knew nothing, of
course, of the change.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your husband won&rsquo;t beat you any more,&rsquo; said good
Philip, as he turned to go; &lsquo;only if he asks you who has been
here send him to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the husband came home and found his wife had become so
beautiful, he kissed her, and was beside himself for joy; and she could
not imagine what had made him so different towards her. &lsquo;Who has
been here?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only Padre Filippo,&rsquo; answered the wife; &lsquo;and he
said that if you asked I was to tell you to go to him;&rsquo; the
husband ran off to him to thank him, and to say how sorry he was for
having beaten her.</p>
<p>But there lived opposite a woman who was also in everything the
opposite of this one. She was very handsome, but as bad in conduct as
the other was good. However, when she saw the ugly wife become so
handsome, she said to herself, &lsquo;If good Philip would only make me
a little handsomer than I am, it would be a good thing for me;&rsquo;
and she went to Padre Filippo and asked him to make her handsomer.</p>
<p>Padre Filippo looked at her, and he knew what sort of woman she was,
and he raised his hand and made the sign of the cross over her, and
prayed, and she became ugly; uglier even than the other woman had
been!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why have you treated me differently from the other
woman?&rsquo; exclaimed the woman, for she had brought a glass with her
to be able to contemplate the improvement she expected him to make in
her appearance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because beauty was of use to her in her state of life,&rsquo;
answered Padre <span class="corr" id="xd26e6555" title=
"Source: Philippo">Filippo</span>. &lsquo;But you have only used the
beauty God gave you as an occasion of sin; therefore a stumbling-block
have I now removed out of your way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he said well, didn&rsquo;t he? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span></p>
<p>One Easter there came to him a young man of good family to
confession, and Padre Filippo knew that every one had tried in vain to
make him give up his mistress, and that to argue with him about it was
quite useless. So he tried another tack. &lsquo;I know it is such a
habit with you to go to see her you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> give it up, so
I&rsquo;m not going to ask you to. You shall go and see her as often as
you like, only will you do something to please me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man was very fond of good Philip, and there was nothing he
would have not done for him except to give up his mistress; so as he
knew that was not in question, he answered &lsquo;yes&rsquo; very
readily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You promise me to do what I say, punctually?&rsquo; asked the
saint.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, father, punctually.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, then; all I ask is that though you go to her as
often as you like, you just pass by this way and come up and pull my
bell every time you go; nothing more than that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man did not think it was a very hard injunction, but when
it came to performing it he felt its effect. At first he used to go
three times a day, but he was so ashamed of ringing the saint&rsquo;s
bell so often, that very soon he went no more than once a day. That
dropped to two or three times a week, then once a week, and long before
next Easter he had given her up and had become all his parents could
wish him to be.</p>

<p class="first">&lsquo;There was another such case; just such another,
only this man had a wife too, but he was so infatuated with the other,
he would have it she loved him the better of the two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and the other was a miniature-painter,&rsquo; broke in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>corroboratively a kind of charwoman who had come
in to tidy the place while we were talking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, she was a miniature-painter,&rsquo; continued the
narrator; &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s I who am telling the story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Padre Filippo said, &ldquo;How much do you allow
her?&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twenty pauls a day,&rsquo; broke in the charwoman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forty scudi a month,&rsquo; said the narrator positively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s not much difference,&rsquo; interposed I,
fearing I should lose the story between them. &lsquo;Twenty pauls a day
is sixty scudi a month. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, Padre Filippo said,&rsquo; continued the
narrator, <span class="corr" id="xd26e6597" title=
"Not in source">&lsquo;</span>&ldquo;Now just to try whether she cares
so much about you, you give her thirty scudi a
month.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fifteen pauls a day,&rsquo; interposed the charwoman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thirty scudi a month!&rsquo; reiterated the narrator.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;Whatever it was, it was to
be reduced.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s it,&rsquo; pursued the narrator; &lsquo;and
he made him go on and on diminishing it. She took it very well at
first, suspecting he was trying her, and thinking he would make it up
to her afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But when she found he didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the
charwoman,</p>
<p>&lsquo;She turned him out,&rsquo; said the narrator, putting her
down with a frown. &lsquo;He was so infatuated, however, that even now
he was not satisfied, and said that in stopping the money he had been
unfair, and she was in the right. So good Philip, who was patience
itself, said, &ldquo;Go and pay her up, and we&rsquo;ll try her another
way. You go and kill a dog, and put it in a bag, and go to her with
your hands covered with blood, and let her think you have got into
trouble for hurting some one, and ask her to hide you.&rdquo; So the
man went and killed a dog.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a cat he killed, because he couldn&rsquo;t find a dog
handy,&rsquo; said the irrepressible charwoman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense; of course it was a dog,&rsquo; asseverated the
narrator. &lsquo;But when he went to her house and pretended
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>to be in a bad way, and asked her to have pity
on him, she only answered: &ldquo;Not I, indeed! I&rsquo;m not going to
get myself into a scrape<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6619src" href=
"#xd26e6619" name="xd26e6619src">6</a> with the law, for
<i>him</i>!&rdquo; and drove him away. And he came and told Padre
Filippo.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said good Philip, &ldquo;go to your
wife whom you have abandoned so long. Go to her with the same story,
and see what she does for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The man took the dead dog in the bag, and ran to the lodging
where his wife was, and knocked stealthily at her door. &ldquo;It is
I,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Come in, husband,&rdquo; exclaimed the wife,
throwing open the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Stop! hush! take care! don&rsquo;t touch
me!&rdquo; said the husband. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s blood upon me. Save
me! hide me! put me somewhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so long since you&rsquo;ve been
here, no one will think of coming after you here, so you will be quite
safe. Sit down and be composed,&rdquo; said the wife soothingly; and
she poured him out wine to drink.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the police were nearer than he fancied. He had thought to
finish up the affair in five minutes by explaining all to her. But
&ldquo;the other,&rdquo; not satisfied with refusing him shelter, had
gone and set the police on his track; and here they were after him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wife&rsquo;s quick ears heard them on the stairs.
&ldquo;Get into this cupboard quick, and leave me to manage
them,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The husband safely stowed away, she opened the door without
hesitation, as if she had nothing to hide. &ldquo;How can you think he
is here?&rdquo; she said when they asked for him. &ldquo;Ask any of the
neighbours how long it is since he has been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Oh, three years,&rdquo; &ldquo;four
years,&rdquo; &ldquo;five,&rdquo; said various voices of people who had
come round at hearing the police arrive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;You see you must have come to the wrong
place,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>she said. And the husband smiled as he heard her
standing out for him so bravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her determined manner had satisfied the police; and they were
just turning to go when one of them saw tell-tale spots of blood on the
floor that had dropped from the dead dog. The track was followed to the
cupboard, and the man dragged to prison. It was in vain that he assured
them he had killed nothing but a dog.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Ha! that will be the faithful dog of the
murdered man,&rdquo; said the police. &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t be long
before we find the body of the man himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wife was distracted at finding her husband, who had but
so lately come back to her, was to be taken away again; and he could
discern how real was her distress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Go to Padre Filippo, and he will set all
right,&rdquo; said the husband as they carried him away. The woman went
to Padre Filippo, and he explained all, amid the laughter of the Court.
But the husband went back to his wife, and never left her any more
after that.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="editorial">[The story was told me another time with this
variation, that the penitent was a peasant<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6658src" href="#xd26e6658" name="xd26e6658src">7</a> who came up
to Rome with his ass, and tied it to a pillar set up for the purpose
outside the church, while he went in to confess. The first time he
went, St. Philip told him he must have nothing more to do with the
occasion of sin, who in this case was a spinner instead of a
miniature-painter. The peasant was so angry with the advice that he
stayed away from confession a whole year. At the end of the year he
came back. St. Philip received him with open arms, saying he had been
praying ever since for his return to a better mind. The sum that formed
the sliding-scale that was to open his eyes to the mercenary nature of
the affection he had so much prized, was calculated at a lower rate
than the other; but the rest of the story was the same.]</p>

<p class="editorial">[Cancellieri has collected some curious incidents
(&lsquo;Morcato,&rsquo; p. 210&ndash;12, Appendix N. xxii.) concerning
an attempt which was made by Princess Anne Colonna to obtain from Urban
VIII. the authority to remove a part of the Saint&rsquo;s body to her
chapel at Naples. The Fathers of the Oratory and the people were
greatly averse to dividing it, as it was very well preserved in its
entirety. By a fatality, which the people readily believed to be
providential, Monsig. Moraldo, who was charged to bring the matter
under the Pope&rsquo;s notice, forgot it every time he was in
attendance on the Pope, though it was the most important thing he had
to say. At last he put the Bull concerning it out on his desk that he
might be sure to remember it, though otherwise he would have kept it
concealed, for it bore the endorsement, &lsquo;Per levare (to remove)
parte del corpo di S. Filippo Neri.&rsquo; While he was talking about
it to one of the papal secretaries standing near the window, a priest,
who had come about other matters, was shown in, and thus happened to
pass by the side of the table when the endorsement of the Bull caught
his eye. With all a Roman&rsquo;s desire to preserve the body to Rome
intact, he immediately gave notice at the Oratory, and two courageous
young fathers took upon themselves to hide the body. When the prelates,
therefore, came shortly after to claim the fulfilment of the Bull, the
Rector opened the shrine in good faith, but the body was not there, and
the report ran among the vulgar that it had been miraculously removed.
Subsequently the Rector gave them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244"
href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>the heart, and drew a tooth
of the Saint, which was a verbal compliance with the terms of the Bull,
being certainly &lsquo;a part of the body.&rsquo; Some years after, the
body was restored to its shrine, and in 1743 Prince Chigi provided it
with velvets and brocades to the value of 1,000 scudi.]</p>

Philip went together once upon a time to the Pardon of Asisi.</p>
<p>As they were three great saints, the Pope sent for them as soon as
they came back, saying he had a question to ask them. It was Innocent
IX. or X., I am not sure which; but I know it was an Innocent.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6738src" href="#xd26e6738" name="xd26e6738src">4</a>
He took them one by one, separately, and began with St. Felix.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were there a great many people at the Pardon?&rsquo; said the
Pope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, an immense number,&rsquo; answered simple St. Felix;
&lsquo;I had not thought the whole world contained such a
number.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then a vast number of sins must have been remitted that
day?&rsquo; said the Pope.</p>
<p>St. Felix only sighed in reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you sigh?&rsquo; asked the Pope.</p>
<p>St. Felix hesitated to reply, but the Pope bade him tell him what
was in his mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There were but few who gained the indulgence in all that
multitude,&rsquo; replied the Saint; &lsquo;for among them all were few
who came with the contrition required.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many were there who did receive it?&rsquo; again asked
the Pope.</p>
<p>Once more St. Felix hesitated till the Pope ordered him to
speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There were only four,&rsquo; he then said. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Only four!&rsquo; exclaimed the Pope. &lsquo;And who were
they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>St. Felix showed even more reluctance to answer this question than
the others; but the Pope made it a matter of obedience, and then he
said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;The four were Father Philip, Father Vincent, one old man, and
one other.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6769src" href="#xd26e6769"
name="xd26e6769src">5</a></p>
<p>The Pope next called for Father Vincent, and went through nearly the
same dialogue with him, and his list was</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father Philip, Father Felix, one old man, and one
other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the Pope sent for St. Philip, and held the same discourse with
him, and his list was</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father Vincent, Father Felix, one old man, and one
other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the Pope saw that their testimony agreed together, and that each
out of humility had abstained from naming that he was one of the
four.</p>
<p>But when the people heard the story, they all began demanding that
the three fathers should be canonized. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">There was Padre Vincenzo too, who wasn&rsquo;t much
less than Good Philip himself. He was a miracle of obedience. One day
when he was ill the Father-General sent him a codfish. Padre Vincenzo
sent back word to thank him, but said he couldn&rsquo;t eat it.
&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; answered the Father-General, who thought he
spoke out of regard to his love of abstinence. &lsquo;Nonsense! tell
him he is to eat it all.&rsquo; The message was given to Padre
Vincenzo, who was really too ill to eat anything; but in his simplicity
thinking he ought to obey, he ate the whole fish, head, tail, bones,
and all.</p>
<p>By-and-by the Father-General came to see him. He seemed almost at
the last gasp, suffocated by the effort he had made, and his throat all
lacerated with swallowing the fish-bones. The Father-General praised
the simplicity of his obedience, but told the brother who took the
message that he ought to have explained it better.</p>
<p>But Padre Vincenzo did not lose anything by his obedience, for that
same evening he was cured of his illness altogether, and was quite well
again. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=

therefore worked no more miracles; but one day as he was walking along
the street, he passed under a high scaffolding of a house that was
being built. Just as he came by, a labourer missed his footing and fell
over from the top. &lsquo;Padre Vincenzo, save me!&rsquo; cried the
man, for everybody knew Padre Vincenzo, and he had just seen him turn
into the street. &lsquo;Stop there!&rsquo; said Padre Vincenzo;
&lsquo;I mustn&rsquo;t save you, as the Padre-Generale says I&rsquo;m
not to work miracles; but wait there, and I&rsquo;ll go and ask if I
may.&rsquo; Then he left him suspended in the air while he ran
breathless to ask permission of the Father-General to work the miracle
of saving him.</p>

such as you, perhaps, cannot see anywhere out of the Rotonda hanging up
for sale. Padre Vincenzo bought the pigeons, and took them home
secretly under his cloak. In his cell he plucked the pigeons, and
cooked them over a little fire. The unwonted smell of roast pigeon soon
perfumed the corridor, and two or three brothers, having peeped through
the keyhole and seen what was going on in Padre Vincenzo&rsquo;s cell,
ran off to say to the Father-General,</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think Padre Vincenzo, whom we all reckon such a
saint, is doing now! He is cooking pigeons privately in his
cell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a calumny! I can&rsquo;t believe it of him,&rsquo;
answered the Father-General indignantly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>&lsquo;I am certain if I do, it will be to cover you with confusion
in some way or other for telling tales!&rsquo; replied the
Father-General as he went with them.</p>
<p>As they passed along the corridor there was the smell of roast
pigeon most undeniably; but when the Father-General opened the cell
door what did they see?</p>
<p>Padre Vincenzo was on his knees, praying for forgiveness in a tone
of earnest contrition; round his throat were tied the two pigeons,
burning hot, as he had taken them from the fire. A spirit of
compunction had seized him as he was about to accomplish the
unmortified act of eating in his cell in contravention of his rule, and
he had adopted this penance for yielding in intention to the
temptation.</p>

<p class="first">There was Padre Fontanarosa too. Did you never hear of
him? He was a good friend to the poor; and all Rome loved him. He was a
Jesuit; but somehow there were some Jesuits who didn&rsquo;t like him.
Papa Braschi<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6840src" href="#xd26e6840"
name="xd26e6840src">1</a> was very fond of him, and used to make him
come every day and tell him all that went on in Rome, for he was very
good to the people, and that way the Pope heard what the people wanted;
and many things that were wrong got set right when Padre Fontanarosa
explained to the Pope the real state of the case.</p>
<p>One day Padre Fontanarosa said to the Pope, &lsquo;People say I have
been talking too freely, and call it telling tales; but I have only
obeyed the wishes of Your Holiness. If I have done wrong send me
away.&rsquo; But Papa Braschi <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249"
href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>answered, &lsquo;You have
done me good service. Fear nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next day after that Padre Fontanarosa did not come to the
Vatican, or the next, or the next.</p>
<p>Then Papa Braschi called for his carriage, and said, &lsquo;Drive to
the Ges&ugrave;!&rsquo; Arrived at the Ges&ugrave;, he said, &lsquo;I
want Padre Fontanarosa; where is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They answered, &lsquo;In his cell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he had been confined in his cell on bread and water for
chattering.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then let him be brought out of his cell; for I want
him!&rsquo; answered Papa Braschi.</p>
<p>That time he took Padre Fontanarosa away in his carriage, and no one
durst say anything to him any more.</p>

<p class="first">Father Fontanarosa was very simple in his habits
himself; and he thought the best way to keep the Order simple was to
keep it poor. Whenever anyone wanted to leave money to it, instead of
encouraging them, he used to tell them of some other good work to which
they might leave it.</p>
<p>One day there was a penitent of his who was very devoted to the
Jesuits, a very rich nobleman, who came to die, and, as he was making
his will, he would have Padre Fontanarosa and the notary present
together. &lsquo;I leave all of which I die possessed to the Church of
the Ges&ugrave;,&rsquo; dictated the rich nobleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! do you leave all to the Son and nothing to the
Mother!&rsquo; said Padre Fontanarosa, who knew he was too weak to
argue with him as to whether the Order was better without the money or
not, and therefore adopted this mode of avoiding the snare, without
damaging the good purpose of the testator.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! you are right,&rsquo; answered the dying man.
&lsquo;Thank you for reminding me. Make a codicil,&rsquo; he said to
the notary, &lsquo;and say I meant it for Ges&ugrave; <i>and</i>
Maria.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=

<p>The notary wrote just what he was bid, and the dying man and the
witnesses signed all duly. But the money had to go, not to &lsquo;the
Ges&ugrave;&rsquo; at all, but to the church of &lsquo;Ges&ugrave; e
Maria&rsquo;&mdash;you know where, at the end of the Corso, which
doesn&rsquo;t belong to the Jesuits at all, but to the
Augustinians.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Others give him not quite such a good character, and
tell the following story of him:&mdash;</p>
<p>The reason why the Jesuits did not look favourably on Father
Fontanarosa was that they thought he went too often to the house of a
certain lady. He perceived that they had found out that he visited her,
but he went on all the same, only he said to her, &lsquo;If anything
happens that the fathers send after me, and anyone comes into the room
suddenly; fall down on your knees before the crucifix, and I will speak
so that I may seem to be here to give you a penitential
warning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There happened to be a handsome crucifix, kept more for ornament
than devotion, on a slab in her boudoir, and she promised to heed his
caution.</p>
<p>One day, when they were together, they heard a ring at the outer
door; then a whispering in the passage; then footsteps in the adjoining
room. Padre Fontanarosa looked at the lady, and the lady looked at
Padre Fontanarosa. Each understood that they were under surveillance.
She fell down on her knees before the crucifix, and he exhorted her to
take a pattern from the Magdalen; and, as she knelt clasping the foot
of the cross, with her beautiful hair all loose over her shoulders, she
really looked like a living picture of the Magdalen. Still no one came
into the room. But they felt they were being watched; so it was
necessary to keep up the deception. Padre Fontanarosa had to speak
loudly and fervently in order to make his words resound well in the
adjoining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>room; the lady had to sob to show she was
attending to them. Still no one came in; and Padre Fontanarosa had to
continue his discourse till, partly through fear lest his courage
should fail, and partly lest he should be discovered, he forced himself
to forget present circumstances, and to throw himself into his
exhortation to such an extent that he preached with a force and
eloquence he had never exercised in his life before.</p>
<p>At last those who had been listening felt satisfied of his
sincerity, and went back to the General and told him there was no fault
to be found in him.</p>
<p>But so effectually had he preached, and so salutary had been his
warnings, that the next day the lady entered a convent, to be a
penitent all her days.</p>

where he slept most nights, too. There was a butcher in the Via
de&rsquo; Serpenti who knew him, and kept a little room for him, where
he made him come and sleep when the nights were bad and cold, or
stormy. These people were very good to him, and, though not well off
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>themselves, were ready to give him a great deal
more than he in his love for poverty would consent to accept.</p>
<p>One great affliction this butcher had; his wife was bedridden with
an incurable disorder. One night there was a terrible storm, it was a
burning hot night in summer, and Giuseppe Labre came to sleep at the
butcher&rsquo;s. He was lying on his bed in the little room, which was
up a step or two higher than the butcher&rsquo;s own room, where his
wife lay, just as it might be where that cupboard is there. Presently
the butcher&rsquo;s wife heard him call her, saying,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sora Angela, bring me a cup of water for the love of
God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My friend, you know how gladly I would do anything to help
you, but my husband is not come up, and I have no one to send, and you
know I cannot move.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless Giuseppe called again, &lsquo;Sora Angela, bring me a
cup of water for the love of God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t call so, good friend,&rsquo; replied she;
&lsquo;it distresses me; you know how gladly I would come if I could
only move.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yet still the third time Giuseppe Labre said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sora Angela, hear me! Bring me a cup of water for the love of
God!&rsquo; And he spoke the words so authoritatively that the good
woman felt as if she was bound to obey him, she made the effort to
rise, and, can you believe it! she got up as if there was nothing the
matter with her; and from that time forward she was cured.</p>

<p class="first">There was a poor cobbler who always had a kind word
for Giuseppe too. One day Giuseppe Labre came to him, and said he
wanted him to lend him a pair of shoes as he was going a pilgrimage to
Loreto. The cobbler knew what a way it was from Rome to Loreto, and
that there would not be much left of a pair of shoes after they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>had done the way there and back. Had Labre asked
him to <i>give</i> them, his regard for him would have prompted him to
assent however ill he could afford it; but to talk of lending shoes to
walk to Loreto and back seemed like making game of him, and he
didn&rsquo;t like it. Nevertheless he couldn&rsquo;t find it in his
heart to refuse, and he gave him a pretty tidy pair which he had
patched up strong to sell, but without expecting ever to see them
again.</p>
<p>Giuseppe Labre took the shoes and went to Loreto, and when he came
back his first call was at the cobbler&rsquo;s shed; and sure enough he
brought the shoes none the worse for all the wear they had had. So
perfectly uninjured were they that the cobbler would have thought they
were another pair had it not been that he recognised the patches of his
own clumsy work.</p>

<p class="first">Another more matter-of-fact account of this story was
that he did not wear the shoes on the journey, as he did that barefoot,
i.e. with wooden sandals, and only borrowed the shoes to be decent and
reverent in visiting the Sanctuary. In this case the story was told me
to illustrate his conscientiousness both in punctually returning the
shoes and in taking so much care of his trust. <span class=

Joseph Labre was born at Boulogne, of parents of the lower middle
class, in 1749, and died 1783. He came to Rome on a pilgrimage when
young, and remained here the rest of his days, passing his time in
prayer and contemplation in the various shrines of Rome. He every year

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a parcel of young fellows once who were a
nuisance to everybody in Rome, for they were always at some mischievous
tricks when it was nothing worse. But there was one of them who was not
altogether so bad as the rest. For one thing, there was one practice of
devotion he had never forgotten from the days when his mother taught
him, and that was, to say a De Profundis whenever he saw a dead body
carried past to burial. But what concerned his companions, was the fear
lest he should some day perhaps take it into his head to reform, and in
that case it was not impossible he might be led to give information
against them.</p>
<p>At last they agreed that the best thing they could do was to put him
out of the way. Quietly as their conspiracy was conducted, he saw there
was something plotting, and determined to be out of reach of their
murderous intentions; so he got up early one morning, and rode out of
Rome.</p>
<p>On, on, on,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7059src" href="#xd26e7059"
name="xd26e7059src">2</a> he went till he had left Rome many miles
behind, and then he saw hanging in an oak-tree the body of a man all in
pieces, among the branches.</p>
<p>For a moment he was overcome with horror at the sight; but,
nevertheless, he did not forget his good practice of saying a De
Profundis.</p>
<p>No sooner had he completed the psalm, than one by one the pieces
came down from the tree and put themselves together, till a dead man
stood before him, all complete. Gladly would he have spurred his horse
on and got away from the horrible sight, but he was riveted to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>spot, and durst not move, or scarcely take
breath. But worse was in store, for now the dreadful apparition took
hold of his bridle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fear nothing, young man!&rsquo; said the corpse, in a tone,
which though meant to be kind, was so sepulchral that it thrilled the
ear. &lsquo;Only change places with me for a little space; you get up
in the oak-tree, and lend your horse to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youth mechanically got off his horse, and climbed up into the
tree, while the mangled corpse got on to the horse, and rode away back
towards Rome. He had not been gone five minutes when he heard four
shots<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7072src" href="#xd26e7072" name=
"xd26e7072src">3</a> fired.</p>
<p>Looking from his elevation in the direction of the sound, he saw his
four evil companions, who had just fired their pieces into the corpse
which rode his horse, without making it sit a bit less erect than
before. Then he saw them go stealthily up to the figure and look at it,
and then run away, wild with terror.</p>
<p>As soon as they had turned their backs, the corpse turned the
horse&rsquo;s head round, and trotted back to the oak-tree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, my son,&rsquo; said the corpse, alighting from the
horse, &lsquo;I have done you this good turn because you said a De
Profundis for me; but such interpositions don&rsquo;t befall a man
every day. Turn over a new leaf, before a worse thing
happens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, the dead body, piece by piece, replaced itself
amid the branches of the oak-tree, where it had hung before.</p>
<p>The young man got on his horse again, penitent and thoughtful, and
rode to a friary,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7086src" href="#xd26e7086"

<p class="first">There was a rich man, I cannot tell you how rich he
was, who died and left all his great fortune to his son, palaces and
houses, and farms and vineyards. The son entered into possession of
all, and became a great man; but he never thought of having a mass said
for the soul of his father, from whom he had received all.</p>
<p>There was also, about the same time, a poor man, who had hardly
enough to keep body and soul together, and he went into a church to
pray that he might have wherewithal to feed his children. So poor was
he, that he said within himself, &lsquo;None poorer than I can there
be.&rsquo; As he said that, his eye lighted on the box where alms were
gathered, that masses might be offered for the souls in Purgatory.
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, then, &lsquo;these are poorer than
I,&rsquo; and he felt in his pocket for his single <i>baiocco</i>, and
he put it in the alms box for the holy souls.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7103src" href="#xd26e7103" name="xd26e7103src">2</a></p>
<p>As he came out, he saw a <i>painone</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7110src" href="#xd26e7110" name="xd26e7110src">3</a> standing
before the door, as if in waiting for him; but as he was well-dressed,
and looked rich, the poor man knew he could have no acquaintance with
him, and would have passed on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have done me so much good, and now you don&rsquo;t speak
to me,&rsquo; said the stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When did I thee much good?&rsquo; said the poor man
bewildered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even now,&rsquo; said the stranger; for in reality he was no
<i>painone</i>, but one of the holy souls who had taken that form, and
he alluded to the poor man&rsquo;s last coin, of which he had deprived
himself in charity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot think to what your Excellency<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7124src" href="#xd26e7124" name="xd26e7124src">4</a>
alludes,&rsquo; replied the poor man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nevertheless it is true,&rsquo; returned the <i>painone</i>;
&lsquo;and now I will ask you to do me another favour. Will you take
this letter to such and such a palace?&rsquo; and he gave <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>him
the exact address. &lsquo;When you get there, you must insist on giving
it into the hands of the master of the house himself. Never mind how
many times you are refused, do not go away till you have given it to
the master himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never fear, your Excellency,&rsquo; answered the poor man,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll deliver it right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he reached the palace, it was just as the <i>painone</i> had
seemed to expect it would be. First the porter came forward with his
cocked hat and his gilt knobbed stick, with the coloured cord twisted
over it all the way down, and asked him whither he was going.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Count so-and-so,&rsquo; answered the poor man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right! give it here,&rsquo; said the splendid porter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By no means, my orders were to consign it to the count
himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go in and try,&rsquo; answered the porter. &lsquo;But you may
as well save yourself the stairs; they won&rsquo;t let such as you in
to the count.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must follow orders,&rsquo; said the poor man, and passed
on.</p>
<p>At the door of the apartment a liveried servant came to open.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you want up here? if you have brought anything, why
didn&rsquo;t you leave it with the porter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because my orders are to give this letter into the
count&rsquo;s own hands,&rsquo; answered the poor man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A likely matter I shall call the &ldquo;Signor Conte&rdquo;
out, and to such as you! Give here, and don&rsquo;t talk
nonsense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No! into the count&rsquo;s own hands must I give
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid; I&rsquo;ve lived here these thirty
years, and no message for the &ldquo;Signor Conte&rdquo; ever went
wrong that passed through my hands. Yours isn&rsquo;t more precious
than the rest, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know nothing about that, but I must follow orders.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;And so must I, and I know my place too well to call out the
&ldquo;Signor Conte&rdquo; to the like of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The altercation brought out the valet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This fellow expects the &ldquo;Signor Conte&rdquo; to come to
the door to take in his letters himself,&rsquo; said the lackey,
laughing disdainfully. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s to be done with the poor
animal?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give here, good man,&rsquo; said the valet, patronisingly not
paying much heed to the remarks of the servant; &lsquo;I am the
&ldquo;Signor Conte&rsquo;s&rdquo; own body servant, and giving it to
me is the same as giving it to himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maybe,&rsquo; answered the poor man, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m too
simple to understand how one man can be the same as another. My orders
are to give it to the count alone, and to the count alone I must give
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take it from him, and turn him out,&rsquo; said the valet,
with supreme disdain, and the lackey was not slow to take advantage of
the permission. The poor man, however, would not yield his trust, and
the scuffle that ensued brought the count himself out to learn the
reason of so much noise.</p>
<p>The letter was now soon delivered. The count started when he saw the
handwriting, and was impelled to tear the letter open at once, so much
did its appearance seem to surprise him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who gave you the letter?&rsquo; he exclaimed, in an excited
manner, as soon as he had rapidly devoured its contents.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot tell, I never saw the person before,&rsquo; replied
the poor man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you know him again?&rsquo; inquired the count.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, most undoubtedly!&rsquo; answered the poor man; &lsquo;he
said such strange things to me that I looked hard at him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then come this way,&rsquo; said the count; and he led him
into a large hall, round which were hung many portraits in frames.
&lsquo;Do you see one among these portraits that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>at
all resembles him?&rsquo; he said, when he had given him time to look
round the walls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that is he!&rsquo; said the poor man, unhesitatingly,
pointing to the portrait of the count&rsquo;s father, from whom he had
inherited such great wealth, and for whom he had never given the alms
of a single mass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then there is no doubt it was himself,&rsquo; said the count.
&lsquo;In this letter he tells me that you of your poverty have done
for him what I with all my wealth have never done,&rsquo; he added in a
tone of compunction. &lsquo;For you have given alms for the repose of
his soul, which I never have; therefore he bids me now take you and all
your family into the palace to live with me, and to share all I have
with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After that he made the man and all his family come to live in the
palace, as his father directed, and he was abundantly provided for the
rest of his life.</p>

<p>The first night after she came the wife suddenly woke up the
husband, saying:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href=
"#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it that kneels at the foot of the bed? surely it is a
white soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see nothing,&rsquo; said the husband; &lsquo;go to
sleep!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The wife said no more, but the next night it was the same thing, and
the next, and the next; and she described so sincerely what she saw,
and with so much earnestness, that the husband could have no doubt that
what she said was true. And as he saw it disturbed her rest, and made
her ill, he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it comes again, to-night, we will conjure it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It had been going on almost a month (I told you it happened in
October), and it was just the night of All Souls&rsquo; day<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7227src" href="#xd26e7227" name="xd26e7227src">3</a>
that he happened to say this.</p>
<p>That night, again, the wife woke him with a start&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There it is,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;the white soul; it
kneels at the foot of the bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The husband said nothing, but following the direction of his
wife&rsquo;s hand, he solemnly bid the apparition depart, in the name
of the Most Holy Trinity and the Madonna.</p>
<p>Though he had seen nothing, he, too, now heard a voice, and the
voice said that it was her father whom the wife had seen; that it was
not well that they should have in the house the woman whom they had
taken in to board, for that it was on her account he was now suffering
penance. &lsquo;Think of this,&rsquo; he said, finally, &lsquo;for I
cannot stay to tell you more; for it is the hour of
prayer.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7239src" href="#xd26e7239"

brightness<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7244src" href="#xd26e7244" name=
"xd26e7244src">5</a> which filled the room as the spirit disappeared.
And this the husband saw well, though he had not seen the soul.</p>
<p>The husband and wife thought a good deal of what they had heard;
they had never known before of the father&rsquo;s intimacy with this
woman, but they inquired, and found it was even so.</p>
<p>Then the man took into his head to go to one of these new people,
what do they call it? <i>spiritismo</i>, <i>magnetismo</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7257src" href="#xd26e7257" name="xd26e7257src">6</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=

spirit of his wife&rsquo;s father, and he asked if it was he who had
appeared at night in the bedroom all the month through, and he said,
&lsquo;yes, that it was.&rsquo; And he asked him about all the
particulars, and he confirmed them all. &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;if indeed it was you, give me some sign to-night;&rsquo; and he
said he would.</p>
<p>There was a ruler in the chest of drawers in the bedroom, and all
through the night there were knocks; now on the ceiling, now on the
floor, now on the walls, as if given with that ruler, and we know those
&lsquo;<i>spiritismo</i>&rsquo; people say the spirits make themselves
understood by knocking.</p>
<p>After that, they sent away their boarder, though at considerable
pecuniary loss.</p>

the invasion of September 1870, Rome has been placarded with
announcements of mediums who may be consulted on every possible
occasion. I give the whole story as it was told me, but I have, of
course, no means of knowing how the <i lang="fr">s&eacute;ance</i> was
conducted, and there is every likelihood the man would be so full of
the strange occurrence that he would begin by letting out all on which
he came to it to seek confirmation. The introduction of these mediums
has been welcomed as supplying the means of gratifying that craving
after the supernatural which was denied them under the former
administration. &lsquo;Witchcraft was forbidden by the former law,
therefore we may suppose it was wrong,&rsquo; reason the less

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">My story is also of a husband and wife, but they were
peasants, and lived outside the gates.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is so cold to-night,&rsquo; said the husband to the wife,
as they went to bed, &lsquo;we shall freeze if we have another night
like it. We must contrive to wake before it is light, and go and get
some wood somewhere before we go to work, to make a fire to-morrow
night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they woke very early, before it was light, and went out to get
wood.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7302src" href="#xd26e7302" name=
"xd26e7302src">2</a> The husband stood up in the tree, and the wife
down below in a ditch, or hole. As she stood there she saw a great
white serpent glide past her. &lsquo;Look, look!&rsquo; she cried to
her husband; &lsquo;see that great white serpent; surely there is
something unnatural about it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A white serpent!&rsquo; answered her husband; &lsquo;what
nonsense! Who ever heard of such a thing as a white serpent!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There it goes, then,&rsquo; said the wife; &lsquo;you can see
it for yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see nothing of the kind,&rsquo; said the husband.
&lsquo;There are no serpents about Rome this many a long year; and as
for a white one, such a thing doesn&rsquo;t exist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While he spoke the serpent went through a hole in the ground. As the
husband was so positive, the wife said no more, but they gathered up
the wood and went home.</p>
<p>In the night, however, the wife had a dream. She <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>saw
an Augustinian friar, long since dead, standing before her, who said
&lsquo;Angela! (that was indeed her name) if you would do me a favour
listen to me. Did you see a white serpent this morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she answered; &lsquo;that I did, though my
husband said there was no such thing as a white serpent in
existence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if you would do me a pleasure, go back to the place
where you saw the white serpent go in&mdash;not where he came out, but
where you saw him go into the earth. Dig about that place, and, when
you have dug a pretty good hole, a dead man will start up;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7321src" href="#xd26e7321" name="xd26e7321src">3</a>
but don&rsquo;t be afraid, he can&rsquo;t hurt you, and won&rsquo;t
want to hurt you. Take no notice of him, and go on digging, and no harm
will come to you; you have nothing to be afraid of. If you dig on you
will come to a heap of money. Take some of the biggest pieces of gold
and carry them to St. Peter&rsquo;s, and take some of the smaller
pieces and carry them to S. Agostino,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7324src" href="#xd26e7324" name="xd26e7324src">4</a> and let
masses be said for that dead man. But you must tell no one alive
anything about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The woman was much too frightened to do what the friar had said, but
she managed to keep the story to herself, though it made her look so
anxious her husband could not help noticing something.</p>
<p>The next night the friar came again, and said the same words, only
he added: &lsquo;If you are so frightened, Angela, you may take with
you for company a little boy, but he must not be over seven, nor under
six; and what you do you must tell no one. But you have nothing to
fear, for if you do as I have said no one can harm you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For all his assurances, however, she could not make up her mind to
go, nor this day could she even keep the story from her husband, for it
weighed upon her mind. When he heard the story he said,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! if you&rsquo;ll go, then I don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; she
said. &lsquo;But how will it be? The friar was so particular that I
should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>tell no one, evil may happen if I take another
with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there is nothing in the story, there&rsquo;s nothing to
fear,&rsquo; said the husband; &lsquo;and, if the story is true, there
is a heap of money to reward one for a little fear; so let&rsquo;s go.
Besides, if you think any harm will happen to you for taking me, I can
stand on the top of the bank while you go down to the hole, and it
can&rsquo;t be said properly that I&rsquo;m there, while I shall yet be
by to give you courage and help you if anything happens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That way, I don&rsquo;t mind it,&rsquo; answered the wife;
and they went out together to the place, the husband, as he had said,
standing by on a bank, and the wife creeping down into a hole. They
took also two donkeys with them to bring away the treasure.</p>
<p>At the first stroke of the woman&rsquo;s spade there came such
lugubrious cries that she was frightened into running away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rsquo; said the husband; &lsquo;cries
don&rsquo;t hurt!&rsquo; So the woman began digging again, and then
there came out cries again worse than before, and the noise of rattling
of chains, dreadful to hear. So terrified was the woman that she
swooned away.</p>
<p>The husband then went down into the hole with what water he could
find to bring her to herself, but the moment he got into the hole the
spirits set upon him and beat him so that he had great livid marks all
over.</p>
<p>After that neither of them had the heart to go back to try it
again.</p>
<p>But the woman was in the habit of going to confession to one of the
Augustinian fathers, and she told him all. The fathers sent and had the
place dug up all about, and thought they had proved there was nothing
there; but for all that, it generally happens that when a thing like
that has to be done, it must be done by the person <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>who
is sent, and anybody else but that person trying it proves nothing at
all.</p>
<p>One thing is certain, that when those horrid assassins<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7357src" href="#xd26e7357" name="xd26e7357src">5</a>
hide a heap of money they put a dead man&rsquo;s body at the entrance
of the hole where they hide it, and say to it, &lsquo;Thou be on guard
till one of such a name, be it Teresa, be it Angela, be it Pietro,
comes;&rsquo; and no one else going can be of any use, for it may be a
hundred years before the coincidence can happen of a person just of the
right name lighting on the spot&mdash;perhaps never.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes! that&rsquo;s a fact; that is not old wives&rsquo;
nonsense,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7362src" href="#xd26e7362"

says, brought his son, a priest, to Rome in the Pontificate of Pius II.

country; a woman whom he had reproved for her bad life had bewitched
him, adding, &lsquo;that the spell (<i>maldicio</i>) was imposed on him
by her under a certain tree, and if it was not removed in the same way,
he could not otherwise be set free; and she would not reveal under what
tree it was.&rsquo; The spell acted upon him only at such times as he
was about to exercise his sacred ministry, and then it impeded his
actions, forced him to put his tongue out at the cross, &amp;c. &amp;c.
&lsquo;The more earnest the devotion with which I strive to give myself
to prayer,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;so much the more cruelly the devil
rends me&rsquo; (<i lang="it">mi lacera</i>). In St. Peter&rsquo;s, the
narrator goes on to say, is a column brought from the Temple of
Solomon, by means of which many possessed persons have been liberated,
because our Lord had leant against it when teaching there, and it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>was thought that this might be sufficiently
potent to represent the fatal tree. He was brought to it, however, in
vain. Being tied to it, and asked to point out the spot where Christ
had touched it, the spirit which possessed him replied by making him
bite it on a certain spot with his teeth and say, &lsquo;Qui stette,
qui stette,&rsquo; (here He stood) in Italian, although he did not know
a word of the language, and was obliged to inquire what the words he
had uttered meant. But the spell, nevertheless, was not got rid of
thus. It was then understood that the spirit must be of that kind of
which Christ had said &lsquo;he goeth not out except by prayer and
fasting;&rsquo; and a pious and venerable bishop, taking compassion on
the man, devoted himself to prayer and fasting for him all through
Lent; and thus he was delivered and sent back to his own country
rejoicing.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e7368src">&uarr;</a></p>

<h2 class="main"><i>THE PROCESSION OF VELLETRI.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Maria Grazia lived in a convent of nuns at Velletri,
and did their errands for them. One night one of the nuns who was ill
got much worse towards night, and the factor<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7387src" href="#xd26e7387" name="xd26e7387src">1</a> not being
there, the Superior called up Maria Grazia and said to
her,&mdash;&lsquo;Maria Grazia, Sister Maria such a one<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7390src" href="#xd26e7390" name="xd26e7390src">2</a>
is so very bad that I must get you to go and call the provost to her.
I&rsquo;m sorry to send you out so late, but I fear she won&rsquo;t
last till morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maria Grazia couldn&rsquo;t say nay to such an errand, and off she
set by a clear moonlight to go to the house of the provost, which was a
good step off and out of the town. All went well till Maria Grazia had
left the houses behind her, but she was no sooner in the open country
than she saw a great procession of white-robed priests and acolytes
bearing torches coming towards her, chanting solemnly. &lsquo;What a
fine procession!&rsquo; thought Maria Grazia; &lsquo;I must hasten on
to see it. But what can it be for at this time of night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still she never doubted it was a real procession till she
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>got quite close, and then, to her surprise, the
procession parted in two to let her go through the midst, which a real
procession would never have done.</p>
<p>You may believe that she was frightened as she passed right through
the midst of those beings who must have belonged to the other world,
dazed as she was with the unearthly light of the flaring torches; it
seemed as if it would last for ever. But it did come to an end at last,
and then she was so frightened she didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Her
legs trembled too much to carry her on further from home, and if she
turned back there would be that dreadful procession again. Curiosity
prompted her to turn her head, in spite of her fears; and what gave her
almost more alarm than seeing the procession was the fact that it was
no longer to be seen. What could have become of it in the midst of the
open field? Then the fear of the good nun dying without the sacraments
through her faint-heartedness stirred her, but in vain she tried to
pluck up courage. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;if there were
only some one going the same road, then I shouldn&rsquo;t
mind!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had hardly formed the wish when she saw a peasant coming along
over the very spot where the procession had passed out of sight.
&lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; she said; for by the light of
the moon he seemed a very respectable steady-looking peasant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did you think of that procession, good man,&rsquo; said
Maria Grazia; &lsquo;for it must have passed close by you,
too?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The peasant continued coming towards her, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t it frighten you? It did me; and I don&rsquo;t
think I could have moved from the spot if you hadn&rsquo;t come up.
I&rsquo;ve got to go to the provost&rsquo;s house, to fetch him to a
dying nun; it&rsquo;s only a step off this road, will you mind walking
with me till I get there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The peasant continued walking towards her, but answered nothing.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re afraid of me, as I was of the procession,
that you don&rsquo;t speak,&rsquo; continued Maria Grazia; &lsquo;but I
am not a spirit. I am Maria Grazia, servant in such and such a convent
at Velletri.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But still the peasant said nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a very odd man!&rsquo; thought Maria Grazia. &lsquo;But
as he seems to be going my way he&rsquo;ll answer the purpose of
company whether he speaks or not.&rsquo; And she walked on without fear
till she came to the provost&rsquo;s house, the peasant always keeping
beside her but never speaking. Arrived at the provost&rsquo;s gate she
turned round to salute and thank him, and he was nowhere to be seen. He
too had disappeared! <span class="corr" id="xd26e7419" title=
"Source: he">He</span> too was a spirit!</p>
<p>When the archpriest came he had his nephew and his servant to go
with him, and they carried torches of straw,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7424src" href="#xd26e7424" name="xd26e7424src">3</a> for it seems
in that part of the country they use straw torches; so she went back in
good company.</p>
<p>And Maria Grazia told me that herself.</p>

there are no ghosts.</p>

<p class="first">&lsquo;Oibo!&rsquo; interposed No. 1.
&lsquo;<i>I</i>&rsquo;ll tell you what ghosts are. Ghosts are most
often robbers, who get people to think they are ghosts, in order to be
able to rob in peace. There was a famous one, I remember well, about
the year 1830, who used to be called the Ghost of St.
John&rsquo;s,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7490src" href="#xd26e7490"
name="xd26e7490src">4</a> because he used to make himself heard in the
houses about St. John Lateran. There were several robberies in the same
neighbourhood just at the same time, but no one thought of connecting
the two things, till at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href=
"#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>last one bethought him of it, and
he laid in wait, pistol in hand, till the ghost came by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By it came; and &ldquo;pop!&rdquo; went the pistol. And
there, on the spot, lay the body of one whom the police didn&rsquo;t
see for the first time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what ghosts are!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">Some friars were going round begging for their
convent, when night overtook them in a wood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What shall we do if any wolves come? I don&rsquo;t believe
there is any habitation in these parts, and there will be no place to
run to and no one to help us. We must commend ourselves to the Madonna,
and wait the event.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They had scarcely done so when one of them saw a light sparkling
through the trees. They thought it came from some woodman&rsquo;s
cottage, and followed its leading; but instead of a cottage they came
to a handsome inn. As the door stood invitingly open they went in: a
fire blazed on the hearth; a repast was spread on the table;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=

white, flitted about and brought all they wanted. When they had well
supped, these led them to a room where was a bed apiece, and in the
morning again they gave them breakfast.</p>
<p>Before they started again, the friars asked the maidens to take them
to offer their thanks to the mistress of the house, and they led them
into a room where was a most beautiful lady, who inquired kindly if
they had been well served and wished them a good journey. Moreover, as
they went she gave them a folded paper.</p>
<p>The friars, unused to be so entertained, were much bewildered, and
wondered what lady it could be who lived all alone with her maidens in
that wild wood; and they turned back to look at the inn that they might
know it again, but it had entirely disappeared, nor was there a vestige
of it to be found.</p>
<p>Then they opened the folded paper the lady had given them, and by
the shining letters within they knew it was the Madonna herself had
entertained them.</p>

them as well as another; but mind I don&rsquo;t believe such
things,&rsquo; said another.</p>
<p class="editorial">&lsquo;Tell me what you&rsquo;ve heard,
then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I have heard say that there was a woman in the
Monti,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7570src" href="#xd26e7570" name=
"xd26e7570src">9</a> and not so long ago either, who was always finding
money about the house, and that too, in places where she knew no one
could have put it. The first thing in the morning when she got up she
would find it on the floor all about the room. Or if she got up from
her work in the middle of the day, though she knew no one had come in,
there it would be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day she saw three silver <i>papetti</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e7577src" href="#xd26e7577" name="xd26e7577src">10</a> on the
floor. It wasn&rsquo;t that there was no silver money ever to be seen,
and nothing but dirty paper notes, and half of them false, as it is now
o&rsquo; days. It was in the time of the Pope, and there was plenty of
silver for those who had money at all, but still, to see three silver
<i>papetti</i> lying on the floor all of a sudden was a sight for
anyone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It looked so strange that she hesitated before she picked it
up. But at last she made up her mind and took it. No sooner had she
done so than a spirit appeared before her, and said, &ldquo;Come down
with me into the cellar and I&rsquo;ll show you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;No, thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the woman, not
knowing what to do for fear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Nonsense! come down, you shan&rsquo;t be
hurt,&rdquo; said the spirit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d <i>rather</i> not, sir, thank
you,&rdquo; was all the woman could stammer out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;You must come! I&rsquo;ll give you something to
make you rich for good and all,&rdquo; persisted the spirit; and,
somehow, she didn&rsquo;t know how, she felt herself obliged to follow
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Down in the cellar was another spirit awaiting her,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>and the moment she got down they took her, the
one by the head and the other by the feet, and laid her into a
coffin<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7600src" href="#xd26e7600" name=
"xd26e7600src">11</a> which stood there all ready on a bier.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7603src" href="#xd26e7603" name=
"xd26e7603src">12</a> One at each end, they took it up, with the woman
in it, and walked round and round the cellar with it, chaunting the
&ldquo;Miserere,&rdquo; and she was too frightened to call out, much
more to attempt to move.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By-and-by they set the bier down, and as she heard nothing
more she concluded the spirits were gone; still she durst not move till
some few rays of daylight began to peep through; then she summoned up
courage to get out of the coffin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When she did so she saw it was all of solid gold, as well as
the bier. There was gold enough to have made her rich to the end of her
days, but she was so frightened that she wasn&rsquo;t able to enjoy it,
but died at the end of a month; for riches that are got in ways that
are not straightforward never profit anyone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the story as it&rsquo;s told; but I don&rsquo;t
believe those things, mind you.&rsquo;</p>

saw &ldquo;One&rdquo; standing by. &ldquo;Come with me!&rdquo; he said;
and the countrywoman, not at all afraid, went with him. He led her by
solitary ways till he came to a lone empty cottage, when he left her.
Quite undaunted, she walked in. There was a large empty room in the
midst, all lighted up with ever so many lights.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch, don&rsquo;t touch!&rdquo;
screamed an anxious voice. &ldquo;Touch! touch!&rdquo; shouted a more

it. It was <i>full</i> of money! Waiting till daylight, she took home

Napoletani&mdash;you know it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, in Via Giulia.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly. Well, she used to take in washing to make a little
for herself more than what her husband gave her. But he didn&rsquo;t
like her doing it, and was very angry whenever he saw her at it. But as
he was out all day at his work, she used to manage to get through with
it in his absence pretty well.</p>

<p class="first">&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s another thing I have heard that
will do for you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There were two who took a peasant and carried him into the
Campagna.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! two ghosts?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no! two fellows who had more money than they knew what to
do with. They took him into the Campagna and made an omelette very
good, with plenty of sweet-scented herbs in it, and made him eat
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then they took a barrel and measured him against it, and then
another, till they found one to fit, and killed him and filled it up
with money, and made a hole in the earth and buried it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And they said over it, &ldquo;No one may disturb you till one
comes who makes an omelette with just the same sweet-scented herbs as
we have used, and makes it just on the top of this hole. Then, come out
and say, &lsquo;This gold is yours.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, of course, in the ordinary course of things, no one
would have thought of making an omelette with just those same herbs,
just on the top of that hole. But there was one who knew the other two,
and suspected something of what they were going to do, and he went up
and hid himself in a tree, and watched all that was done, and heard the
words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As soon as they were gone he came down and took some nice
fresh eggs, and just the same sweet-scented herbs the others had used,
and made an omelette just over the hole where he had seen them bury the
barrel with the money and the man in it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>&lsquo;He had no sooner done so than the man came out all whole and
well, and said: &ldquo;Oh, how many years have I been shut up in that
dark place&rdquo; (though he hadn&rsquo;t been there half-an-hour)
&ldquo;till you came to deliver me! Therefore all the gold is
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="editorial">[These treasure stories are common everywhere. In
Tirol, especially, they abound, and are of two kinds. First, concerning
treasure hidden in the earth, arising out of the metal mines that were
formerly worked there, and the carbuncles which are still found; and
the second, precisely like these, of money walled-up in old houses and
castles. A countryman, who saw me sketching the old ruin of Monte
Rufiano, on a height not far from the banks of Lake Thrasimene, told me
a story about it, just like a Tirolese story, of treasure hidden ever
so deep under it, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href=
"#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>guarded by twelve spectres, who
went about, carrying torches in procession, on a Good Friday.</p>
<p class="editorial">Senhor de Saraiva tells me there is a great
variety of such stories in Portugal, where the treasures are generally
said to have been hidden by the Moors, and are supposed to be buried
under a gigantic depth of rock. A place was once pointed out to him,
where there were said to be two enormous jars, one full of gold, and
the other of boiling pitch. If, in digging, a man came upon the right
one, he would be rich enough to buy up the whole world; but if, by ill
luck, his spade first reached the other, the pitch would overflow and
destroy everyone on the face of the earth; so that no one dared to make
the attempt. The people believe that such localities may be revealed to
them in dreams. But they must dream the same dream three nights
running, and not tell it to anyone. If they tell it, they will find the
money all turned to charcoal. Brick boxes of charcoal have frequently
been found buried under Roman boundary stones in Portugal, and in this,
he thinks, lies the origin of this latter fancy.</p>

<p class="editorial">It is remarkable how many odds and ends of history
remain laid up in the memories of the Roman people, like the majolica
vases and point-lace in their houses. A great favourite with them is
the story of Beatrice Cenci, which they tell, under the name of
&lsquo;La bella Cenci,&rsquo; with more or less exaggeration of
detail.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There were two of the Colonna. One was Sciarra; I
don&rsquo;t know the name of the other. They were always fighting
against the pope of their time.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7759src"
href="#xd26e7759" name="xd26e7759src">1</a> At last they took him and
shut him up in a tower in the Campagna, and kept him there till they
had starved him to death; and when the people found him afterwards,
what do you think?&mdash;in his extremity he had gnawed off all the
tips of his fingers.</p>
<p>When these two Colonna found they had actually <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>killed a Pope, they got so frightened that they
ran away to hide themselves. They ran away to France, to Paris, and at
last, when all the money they were able to carry with them was spent,
they were obliged to take a place as stablemen in the king&rsquo;s
palace, and they washed the carriages and cleaned down the horses like
common men. But they couldn&rsquo;t hide that they were great lords;
the people saw there was something different from themselves about
them, and they watched them, and saw that they waited on each other
alternately every day at table, and you could see what great ceremony
they were used to. Then other things were seen, I forget what now, but
little by little, and by one thing and another, people suspected at
last who they really were.</p>
<p>Then some one went and told the king of France, and he had them
called up before him.</p>
<p>They came just as they were, in their stable clothes, wooden
shoes<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7770src" href="#xd26e7770" name=
"xd26e7770src">2</a> and all.</p>
<p>The king sat to receive them in a raised seat hung all round with
cloth of gold, and he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, I know one thing. You two are hiding from justice. Who
you are I don&rsquo;t know exactly for certain. I believe you are the
Colonna. If you confess you are the Colonna, I will make the affair
straight for you; but, if you will not say, then I will have you shut
up in prison till I find out who you are, and what you have
done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then they owned that they were the Colonna,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7779src" href="#xd26e7779" name="xd26e7779src">3</a> and the king
sent an ambassador to the Pope that then was, and the thing was
arranged, and after a time they came back to Rome. <span class=

Sciarra Colonna headed a band of &lsquo;spadassini&rsquo; against
Boniface VIII., and made himself the tool of Philippe le Bel, is of
course true to history, as also that he held him imprisoned for a time
at Anagni. The Pontiff&rsquo;s biographer, Tosti, mentions however only
to refute them, &lsquo;le favole Ferretiane,&rsquo; to which Sismondi,
&lsquo;Storia delle Republiche italiane,&rsquo; gives currency, and
which embody the floating tradition in the text. &lsquo;Ferreto da
Vicenza,&rsquo; writes Tosti, &lsquo;narrates that a kind of poison was
administered to this great Pontiff, which put him in a state of
phrenzy; the servant who waited on him, also, was sent away, and being
left alone in the room he is supposed to have gnawed at a stick (in
another allusion to the same fable&mdash;at page 293&mdash;he says,
&lsquo;his fingers&rsquo; as in the text), and struck his head against
the wall so desperately that his white hairs were all stained with
blood; finally, that he suffocated himself under the counterpane
invoking Beelzebub. But when we think how Boniface arrived at extreme
old age, enfeebled with reverses; how, shut up in a room alone, there
was no one to be witness to the alleged gnawing and knocking and
Satanic invocations, and how that the manner of his death was quite
differently related by eye-witnesses, I do not know for whom Sismondi
could have thought he was writing when he marred his history by
inserting such a fable. What certainly happened, and it is certified by
Cardinal Stefaneschi, who was present, and by the Report afterwards
drawn up of the acts of Boniface&mdash;was, that &lsquo;he was lodged
in the Vatican at the time of his death, and breathed his last
tranquilly. The bed of the dying Pontiff was surrounded by eight
cardinals and by other distinguished persons (Process. Bonif. p. 37, p.
15), to whom, according to the custom of his predecessors, he made
confession of faith, affirming, however enfeebled his voice, that he
had lived in that faith, and wished to die in it, a Catholic. Consoled
with the Viaticum of the Sacraments he gave up his soul to God, weary
with the prolonged struggle he had sustained for the rights of the
Church, &hellip; thirty-five days after his imprisonment at
Anagni&rsquo; (vol. ii. p. 286&ndash;7). Platina goes into less detail,
but also records that he died in Rome (Le vite de&rsquo; Pontefici,
Venice, 1674, p. 344). The magnanimous stedfastness evinced by Boniface
when attacked by Colonna and Nogaret, all abandoned as he was by human
aid (detailed by Tosti, p. 276, <i>et seq.</i>), could not but have
been succeeded by a grander closing scene than that imagined by
Ferreto. Maroni (vi. 17&ndash;18) not only narrates that he survived
the Anagni affair to return to Rome, but that with great Christian
charity he ordered Nogaret, who had been taken prisoner by the Romans
in the meantime, to be released from confinement; and [xiv. 283] that
he could have had no poison administered to him at Anagni, for all the
time he was imprisoned he would eat nothing but eggs on purpose to be
proof against it.<a id="xd26e7785" name="xd26e7785"></a> The best
disproof of the story, however, is that given by Tosti (p.
296&ndash;7). In the clearing for the rebuilding of the nave of St.
Peter&rsquo;s, 302 years after the death of Boniface, his sepulchre was
opened and the grave then revealed the truth. It so happened that his
body had scarcely undergone any change, and those who stood by could
hence depose that both his head and his hands were quite perfect;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>there were no marks or blows on the former, and
so far from his finger-tips being gnawed, they noticed that the nails
even were particularly long. The face also wore a peculiarly placid
expression.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Several contemporary writers cited by Tosti
tell, however, that Benedict XI., Boniface&rsquo;s successor, died of
poison believed to have been administered by Sciarra Colonna at the
instigation of Philippe le Bel. But unfortunately for the tradition in
the text Moroni [xiv. 283], who also mentions this, adds that Sciarra
Colonna died in exile as he deserved. The two Cardinals Colonna,
however, who had been exiled with the rest of the family, were
reinstated by Benedict XI., and Clement V. in 1305 restored the other
members of it to their possessions in the Roman States, where they made
themselves obnoxious enough during the Papal residence at Avignon, and
were as hostile to Rienzi as they had ever been to the
Popes.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e7779src">&uarr;</a></p>

Cancellieri Mercato, &sect; viii. As I have been desirous to put
nothing in the text but what has reached myself by verbal tradition, I
will add some no less interesting details collected by Cancellieri, in
this place.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">It was at her house in Piazza Navona that
Bernini was rehabilitated in his character of first sculptor and
architect of his time. &lsquo;Papa Pamfili,&rsquo; though only the son
of a tailor,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7836src" href="#xd26e7836"
name="xd26e7836src">6</a> was yet a patron of art. Highly famed under
Urban VIII. the preceding Pontiff, Bernini had been misrepresented by
his rivals to Innocent. In an unpublished Diary of Giacinto Gigli,
Cancellieri finds that he was taken so seriously ill on St.
Peter&rsquo;s Day, 1641<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7839src" href=
"#xd26e7839" name="xd26e7839src">7</a> that his life was for some time
despaired of, in consequence of his Campanile&mdash;a specimen one of
two he had designed for St. Peter&rsquo;s&mdash;being disapproved by
the Pope and ordered to be taken down. Another cognate tradition he
gives from a MS. Diary of Valerio is, that in digging the foundations
for this tower a &lsquo;<span lang="it">canale
d&rsquo;acqua</span>&rsquo; was discovered deeper than the bed of the
Tiber and wide enough to go on it in a boat; Mgr. Costaguti,
maggiordomo of his Holiness, told me about it himself, and he had had
himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>let down to see it. As it had a sandy bottom, it
washed away the foundations of the tower, and rendered it impossible to
leave it standing. The water came from Anguillara&rsquo; (on Lake
Bracciano, about 28 miles) &lsquo;and the Pope had the old conduit
reconstructed and used the water for many fountains in imitation of
Sixtus V.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7853src" href="#xd26e7853" name=
"xd26e7853src">8</a> He goes on to add an extraordinary account of a
Dragon quite of the legendary type, that was found in charge of this
water, and was killed, not by a hero or a knight, but, by the labourers
working at the conduit.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">It was Innocent X.&rsquo;s ambition to remove
the great obelisk (since called &lsquo;Obelisco Pamfilio&rsquo;) which
lay in three pieces in the Circo di Massenzio, near the Appian Way, and
to set it up in Piazza Navona. Bernini being, as I have said, in
disfavour, other architects were commissioned to offer designs for the
work; but the Pope was not satisfied with any of them, and the matter
stood over. Meantime Piombino (Niccol&ograve; Ludovisi) who<a id=
"xd26e7861" name="xd26e7861"></a> had married a niece of the
Pope&rsquo;s, and who was a great friend of Bernini, privately
instructed him to send him a model of what he would suggest for the
purpose, saying he wanted it for his own satisfaction, lest Bernini
should refuse the unauthorised competition. Bernini then produced the
elaborate conception which has been so warmly extolled by some and so
hastily blamed by others, but which cannot be judged without a
prolonged study of all the poetical allegories and conceits it was his
intention to embody.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The Pope went to the house of Donna Olimpia in
Piazza Navona to dine after the Procession to the Minerva on the
Annunciation,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7865src" href="#xd26e7865"
name="xd26e7865src">9</a> and she placed the model in a room through
which the Pope must pass after dinner. It did not fail to arrest his
notice, and he was so much struck with it that he spent half an hour
examining it in detail and listening to the explanation of its
emblematical devices. At last he exclaimed, &lsquo;It can be by no
other hand than Bernini&rsquo;s! and he must be employed in spite of
all that may be said against him!&rsquo; From that time Bernini was
once more all that he had been before in Rome (Mercato, &sect; ix.).
When Innocent saw the great work completed, and the water of the four
rivers for the first time gushing from it, he declared to Bernini he
had given him pleasure great enough to add ten years to his life; and
he sent over to Donna Olimpia for a hundred
&lsquo;Doppie&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7868src" href=
"#xd26e7868" name="xd26e7868src">10</a> to distribute among the
workmen. Subsequently he had a medal struck with the inscription
<span class="sc" lang="la">Agonalium cruore abluto Aqua Vergine</span>,
in allusion to the games of which Piazza Navona is supposed<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7880src" href="#xd26e7880" name=
"xd26e7880src">11</a> to have been the scene, and the
&lsquo;Vergine&rsquo; aqueduct from which the fountains were supplied.
&lsquo;Papa Pamfili&rsquo; also restored St. John Lateran, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>undertook many other works, but was somewhat
hampered by the discontent of the people at the expense, expressed in
the following pasquinades:</p>

<p class="footnote cont">To return to Donna Olimpia. One of the
pasquinades on her preserved in Cancellieri from Gigli&rsquo;s diary,
refers to an accusation against her, that she had been very liberal
both to religious communities and to the people until her
brother-in-law<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7909src" href="#xd26e7909"
name="xd26e7909src">12</a> was made Pope, and that when that object was
attained she ceased her bounty. Pasquin wrote upon this, &lsquo;Donna
Olimpia <a id="xd26e7919" name="xd26e7919"></a>fuerat olim pia, nunc
impia.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Another declared that the said brother-in-law
&lsquo;Olympiam potius quam Olympum respicere videbatur,&rsquo; an
accusation he declares to have been invented solely for the sake of
punning, and without any truth, on faith of the character given him by
his biographers, and of the fact that he was more than seventy-one when
raised to the Papacy, and so deformed and ugly that Guido put his
portrait under the feet of the archangel in his famous picture of St.
Michael. (Mercato, Appendix, n. 4 to N. x.) She was, however, sometimes
inexcusable in her haughty caprices, as, for instance, when she invited
five and twenty Roman ladies to see a pageant, and then asked only
eight of them to sit down to table with her, leaving the remainder
&lsquo;mortificate alle finestre;&rsquo; and frequently more free than
choice in her <i>mots</i>. Her grandchildren seem to have inherited
this freedom of speech; Gigli (quoted by Cancellieri, Mercato &sect;
xvi. and xx.) records in his Diary that the eldest of them,
Giambattista, being asked one day by the Pope, who took great notice of
him, if he had seen St. Agnese in Piazza Navona, which he was then
building, replied (though only seven years old), &lsquo;I have not seen
it yet; but you, if you don&rsquo;t make haste, won&rsquo;t live to see
it completed.&rsquo; It would seem to have been a popular prophecy
which the child had caught up, and it so happens that the event bore it
out.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">There is nothing, however, which shows the
heartless character of Donna Olimpia more glaringly than her refusal to
pay a farthing to bury the Pope, alleging she was &lsquo;only a poor
widow!&rsquo; and this, though the Pope had not only &lsquo;favoured
her so much as to endanger his reputation,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7928src" href="#xd26e7928" name="xd26e7928src">13</a> but had
handed to her all his disposable property on his deathbed. Donna
Olimpia so utterly abandoned his body that it was carried down into a
lumber-room where workmen kept their tools, and one poor labourer had
the charity to buy a tallow candle to burn beside it, and another paid
some one to watch it, to keep the mice off which abounded there.
Finally, a Mgr. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291"
name="pb291">291</a>]</span>Scotti, his maggiordomo, paid for a coffin
of &lsquo;<span lang="it">albuccio</span>,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7936src" href="#xd26e7936" name="xd26e7936src">14</a> and a
former maggiordomo, whom he had dispossessed, gave five scudi
(returning good for evil) to pay the expenses of burying him. It was
not till twelve years later that he had a fitting funeral in S. Maria
dell&rsquo; Anima.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">When a few months after Innocent&rsquo;s death
Donna Olimpia endeavoured to put herself on her old footing at the
Vatican Court, by sending a valuable present of some gold vases to
Alexander VII., that Pope testified his appreciation of her by
returning her offering; adding the message that she was not to take the
trouble to visit his palace, as it was no place for women.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7941src" href="#xd26e7941" name=
"xd26e7941src">15</a> There was subsequently some angry correspondence
between her and this Pope concerning the delays occasioned by her
parsimony in completing the church in Piazza Navona, and the consequent
obstruction of the Piazza, a great inconvenience to the public on
account of its use as a market-place. Finally he banished her from
Rome, fixing her residence at Orvieto, where she fell a victim to the
plague two years after.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Her palace in Piazza Navona became in 1695 the
residence of Lord Castlemaine, ambassador of James II. to the Holy See.
He had an ox roasted whole before it, and other bounties distributed to
the people on occasion of the birth of &lsquo;The
Pretender.&rsquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

certain Niccolo Caferri was much ridiculed for the spirit of adulation
with which he pretended to trace up Innocent X.&rsquo;s genealogy to
Pamphilus, king of Doris, 300 years before the birth of Rome. But the
Pope himself was so little ashamed of his origin that Cancellieri tells
us he took a piece of cloth for one of his armorial bearings in memory
of it.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e7836src">&uarr;</a></p>

<h2 class="main"><i>THE MUNIFICENCE OF PRINCE BORGHESE.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first editorial">[If the Romans remember the vices of their
princely families, they are proud of storing up the memory of their
virtues too; and the following narrative was told me with great
enthusiasm.]</p>
<p>Liberality is a distinguishing characteristic of the Borghese
family. It was always a matter of emulation who should get taken into
their service, and no one who was once placed there ever let himself be
sent away again, it was too good a thing to lose.</p>
<p>There was a man-servant, however, once who gave the Prince, I think
it was the father of this one, an insolent answer, and he turned him
off.</p>
<p>No one would take that man. Wherever he applied, when they asked
him, &lsquo;Where have you lived?&rsquo; and he answered,
&lsquo;<i lang="it">in casa Borghese</i>,&rsquo; everyone answered,
&lsquo;Oh, if you couldn&rsquo;t live with Borghese, I&rsquo;m sure
I&rsquo;ve nothing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292"
name="pb292">292</a>]</span>better to offer you!&rsquo; and the door
was shut in his face. It wasn&rsquo;t in one place or two, but
<i>everywhere</i>, Borghese&rsquo;s character is so well known in Rome.
As he couldn&rsquo;t get a place, however, he was reduced to near
starvation, and he had a wife and six children, all with nothing to
eat. Every article of furniture went to the Monte di Piet&agrave;, and
almost every article of clothing; and yet hunger stared them in the
face.</p>
<p>Then the man got desperate, and he went out one night and waited for
Borghese in a lonely street in the dark, with a knife in his hand, and
said, &lsquo;Your purse!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Borghese thought he had a gang behind him, round the corner, and
handed him his purse. But the man only took out three pauls and gave it
back, and he looked so thin and haggard that Borghese could not but
notice it, dark as it was, though he had forgotten his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not a thief, he is some poor fellow who wants
relief,&rsquo; said Borghese to his servant. &lsquo;Go after him and
see what he does, but take care not to be seen,&rsquo; and he walked
home alone. In less than half an hour the servant came back. He had
seen him spend the three pauls in food; had seen him take it home to
his family; had seen them scarcely covered with rags; had seen the room
denuded of furniture; had heard the man say, as he put the food on the
table, &lsquo;Here is wherewith to keep you alive another day, and
to-morrow I die in sin, for I had to steal it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Borghese called up the steward (Maestro di Casa), and told him
to go to the house and find out who the man was, and leave them what
was wanted for the night.</p>
<p>The steward did as he was told, and left a scudo that the man might
get a supper without eating stolen food, but without saying who sent
him, for he had learnt by his inquiries that he was the servant whom
Borghese had sent away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=
"#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next day Borghese sent and clothed all the family; furnished
their place again for them; put the children to schools, and gave the
parents ten scudi a month. He wouldn&rsquo;t take the man back, having
once had to send him away&mdash;for that was his rule&mdash;but he gave
him a pension for the rest of his life.</p>

<h2 class="main"><i>GIACINTA MARESCOTTI.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a prince Marescotti,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8026src" href="#xd26e8026" name="xd26e8026src">1</a> who had two
daughters, Cecilia and Giacinta. From her childhood Cecilia had always
been gentle and pious, and everyone said, &lsquo;When she grows up she
will be a nun.&rsquo; Giacenta was proud, handsome, and passionate, and
everyone said, &lsquo;She will be a leader of society, and woe betide
whoso offends her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But their father, good man,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8031src"
href="#xd26e8031" name="xd26e8031src">2</a> knew them better, and one
day he announced to them the choice of a state of life which he had
made for them; for the pious, gentle Cecilia there was a great lord
coming from abroad to make her his wife; but the proud, passionate
Giacinta was to enter a convent.</p>
<p>The one was as dismayed as the other at the time, though the event
showed he had chosen right. Cecilia, who loved quiet and repose,
tenderly entreated her father to let her off the anxieties and
responsibilities of becoming the head of a great family, while Giacinta
made a great noise<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8036src" href=
"#xd26e8036" name="xd26e8036src">3</a> at the idea of her beauty and
talents being laid up hidden in a nun&rsquo;s cell. Nevertheless, in
those days long gone by, girls were used to obey.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8039src" href="#xd26e8039" name="xd26e8039src">4</a> Cecilia
married and proved herself an exemplary wife and mother, and carried
respect for religion wherever she went.</p>
<p>Giacinta, on the other hand, took all her worldly state into her
convent with her; her cell was furnished like the drawing-room of a
palace, and she insisted on having her maids to wait on her; the other
nuns she scarcely spoke to, and treated as the dust under her feet.</p>
<p>One day the bishop came to visit the convent. &lsquo;What a
smell!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8055src" href="#xd26e8055"
name="xd26e8055src">5</a> he said, as he passed the cell of Giacinta
Marescotti.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A smell, indeed! In my cell which is not only the sweetest in
the convent, but which is the only one fit to go into!&rsquo; exclaimed
poor Giacinta in deep indignation. &lsquo;What can you possibly mean by
&ldquo;a smell!&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb295" href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;A smell of sin!&rsquo; responded the bishop; and it was
observed that for a wonder Giacinta made no retort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A smell of sin,&rsquo; said Giacinta to herself, as she sat
alone in her elegant and luxurious cell that night. The words had
touched her soul and awakened a train of thoughts latent and
undisturbed till then. Always hitherto she had ambitioned the loftiest,
most refined objects of research, and thought she knew the secret of
attaining them. The bishop&rsquo;s words spoke to her of there being
&lsquo;a more excellent way&rsquo; yet. They cast a light upon a higher
path than that which she was treading, and revealed to her that those
who walked along it, lowly as they might seem, could afford to look
down upon hers.</p>
<p>She saw that those who despised distinctions were grander than those
who courted them, to become, in the end, their slaves; that those who
aspired to celestial joys were nobler than those who surrounded
themselves with the most exquisite luxuries of earth.<a class="noteref"

following are briefly the authentic particulars of her life from
Moroni, xxx. 194. She was daughter of Marc Antonio Mariscotti and
Ottavia Orsini, born in 1535, and baptised by the name of Clarice.
Although brought up in the fear of God and led to appreciate holiness,
her youth was passed in worldliness and vanity. Her younger sister
having been asked in marriage before her, she was so much vexed and
annoyed that she became insupportable at home, on which account her
father proposed to her to become a nun in the convent of S. Bernardino
at Viterbo, where she had been educated, and she adapted herself to his
counsel, though without any personal inclination for it. At the end of
her noviciate she made her father arrange that she should have a room
of her own magnificently furnished. Sister Giacinta lived ten years
thus a religious in name but not in mind. Nevertheless she was not
without virtue, for she was always obedient to her superior as she had
been to her parents; and her modesty, purity, and respect for holy
things was observed by all. A serious illness was to her the call of
grace; having given up to the abbess of the convent all the things that
had been brought in for her use by special privilege, she devoted
herself to severe penance and continual meditation. On occasion of a
contagious disease with which Viterbo was afflicted, she gave abundant
proof of her charity towards her neighbour, for she founded two
societies, the object of one of which was to collect assistance for the
convalescent and those who had fallen into reduced circumstances; the
other to support a hospital built to receive the sick. These two
societies, which she called &lsquo;Oblates of Mary,&rsquo; still
continue (the date of Moroni&rsquo;s work is 1845) in full
activity.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e8081src">&uarr;</a></p>

<p class="first">&lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t say I remember any
pasquinades, not to repeat; but I know what happened once when they
tried to stop them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There had been so many one time that the Government put a
guard all round about Pasquino to watch and see who did it, but for a
long time they saw no one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One night, at last, a clownish countryman came by with a
bundle of hay on his back, drivelling and half silly. &ldquo;Let me sit
here a bit to rest; I&rsquo;m so weary with carrying this load I
can&rsquo;t go any farther; but I won&rsquo;t do any harm.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;The guards laughed at the poor idiot&rsquo;s simplicity in
fancying they could expect such as he to be the author of the witty,
pungent sort of wares they were on the search for, and said with
contemptuous pity, &ldquo;Yes, yes; <i>you</i> may sit there!&rdquo;
And the stupid old countryman sat down at the foot of the statue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Heaven reward you for your kindness!&rdquo; he
said, when he got up after half-an-hour&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it; go in peace!&rdquo;
returned the guards, and the man passed out of sight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next morning, high over head of Pasquino floated a gay paper
balloon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;The balloon! the balloon!&rdquo; screamed the
street urchins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;The balloon! the balloon!&rdquo; shouted a
number of men, assembled by preconcerted arrangement, though seemingly
passers-by attracted by the noise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The clumsy clodhopper of overnight was an adroit fellow
disguised, and he had attached the string of the balloon to the
statue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To seize the string, pull down the balloon, and burst it was
quick work; but out of it floated three hundred and sixty-six stinging
pasquinades, which were eagerly gathered up.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">&lsquo;Many a time a simple exterior is a useful
weapon; but when a man who is really simple pretends to be clever he is
soon found out. For another time there had been a pasquinade which so
vexed the Government that the Pope declared whoever would acknowledge
himself the author of it should have his life spared and five hundred
scudi reward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day a simple-looking rustic came to the Vatican, and said
he was come to own himself the author of the pasquinade. As such he was
shown in to the Pope. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href=
"#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;So you are the author of this pasquinade, are
you, good man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Yes, Your Holiness, I wrote it,&rdquo; answered
the fellow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;You are quite sure you wrote it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Oh, yes, Your Holiness, quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Take him and give him the five hundred
scudi,&rdquo; said the Pope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An acute Monsignore, who felt convinced the man could not be
the author of the clever satire, could not refrain from interposing
officially when he found the Pope really seemed to be taken in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;They have their orders,&rdquo; said the Pope,
who was no less discerning than he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A chamberlain took the man into a room where five hundred
scudi lay counted on the table, and at the same time put on a pair of
handcuffs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Halloa now! What is this? It was announced that
the man who owned himself the author of the Pasquinade should have his
life free and five hundred scudi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;All right; no one is going to touch your life,
and there are the five hundred scudi. But you couldn&rsquo;t imagine
that the man who wrote that satire would be allowed to go free about
Rome. That was self-evident&mdash;there was no need to say
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Oh, but I never wrote a word of it, upon my
honour,&rdquo; exclaimed the countryman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;I thought not,&rdquo; said the Pope, who had
come in to amuse himself with the fellow&rsquo;s confusion. &ldquo;Now
go, and another time don&rsquo;t pretend to any worse sins than your
own.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href=

<p class="editorial">[The &lsquo;Pasquino&rsquo; statue was not only
the receptacle of the invectives of the vulgar, it often served also to
mark the triumphs of the great. The first time it was put to this use
was in 1571, on occasion of the triumph of M. A. Colonna, when the
parts wanting were restored, and it was clad in shining armour. On
various occasions, as a new pope went in procession from the Vatican to
perform the ceremony called &lsquo;taking possession&rsquo; of St. John
Lateran, it was similarly <i lang="it">risanato del suo stroppio
ordinario</i> (healed of the usual lameness of its members), and made
to bear a sword, a balance, a cornucopia, and other emblematical
devices, which are given at great length by Cancellieri.</p>
<p class="editorial">The opinions of Winkelman, and others, concerning
the great artistic merits both of this statue and that called
&lsquo;Marforio,&rsquo; do not belong to our present aspect of it.
Sprenger, &lsquo;Roma nuova,&rsquo; says that besides these two there
was another statue which used to take part in this satirical converse,
namely, that of the Water-seller, with his barrel (commemorative of a
well-known, though humble character), opposite the Church of S.
Marcello, in the Corso, which the present rulers, ignorant of Roman
traditions, removed. The Romans, however, clamoured against its
destruction, and it is now replaced round the corner, up the Via
Lata.]</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8089" href="#xd26e8089src" name="xd26e8089">1</a></span> The
statue called by this name was not originally found in its present
situation. The shop of the tailor Pasquino was in the Via in Parione, a
turning out of the Via del Governo Vecchio, some little distance off,
nor was it discovered at all till after Pasquino&rsquo;s death. At his
time it was buried unperceived in the pavement of the street, and the
inequalities of its outline afforded stepping-stones by means of which
passengers picked their way through the puddles! Cancellieri (Mercato,
appendix, N. iii.)] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299"
name="pb299">299</a>]</span>quotes a passage from a certain Tibaldeo di
Ferrara, quoted in a book, his dissertation concerning the author of
which is too long to quote. This Tibaldeo, however, says, &lsquo;as the
street was being repaired, and I had the shop that was Pasquino&rsquo;s
made level, the trunk of a statue, probably of a gladiator, was found,
and the people immediately gave it his name.&rsquo; He, however, quotes
from other writers mention of other sites for its discovery mostly
somewhat nearer to the present situation. The site of the present
Palazzo Braschi was then occupied by the so-called Torre Orsini, a
building of a very different ground-plan. Cancellieri quotes from more
than one MS. diary that at the time the Marquis de Cr&eacute;quy came
to Rome as ambassador of Louis XIII. in 1633, the Palazzo de&rsquo;
Orsini, where he was lodged, was designated as &lsquo;sopra
Pasquino.&rsquo; And again from another MS. diary, that in 1728, when
the palace was bought by the Duca di Bracciano-Odoscalchi, the same
designation remained in use. In the Diary of Cracas, under date March
19, 1791, is an entry detailing the care with which the Pasquino statue
was removed to a pedestal prepared for it in front of Palazzo Pamfili
during the completion of the contiguous portion of the Palazzo Braschi,
and its restoration is duly entered on the 14th March of the same
year.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8094src" href="#xd26e8094" name=

<p class="footnote cont">It was Adrian VI. (not Alexander VI. as Murray
has it), who proposed to throw it into the Tiber. Adrian VI. was a
victim of pasquinades for two reasons,&mdash;the first, because born at
Utrecht and tutor of Charles V., and afterwards viceroy in Spain,
during all Charles&rsquo; absence in Germany Rome feared at his
election that he would set up the Papal See in Spain; and it is not
altogether impossible that the popular satires may have had some
influence in deciding him on the contrary to repair immediately to
Rome,&mdash;the second, because he was an energetic and unsparing
reformer; and those who were touched by his measures were just those
who could afford to pay the hire of the tongues of popular wags.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Nor was it only during his life that he was
the subject of such criticisms. When his rigorous reign was suddenly
brought to a close after he had worn the tiara but twenty months, on
the door of his physician was posted this satire, &lsquo;Liberatori
Patri&aelig; S.P.Q.R.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8113src" href=
"#xd26e8113" name="xd26e8113src">3</a>; and his tomb in St.
Peter&rsquo;s, between that of Pius II. and Pius III., was disgraced
with this epitaph: &lsquo;<i lang="la">Hic jacet impius inter
Pios</i>,&rsquo; till some years later, when his body was removed to a
worthier monument in S. Maria del Anima.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

clearly a typographical error about one of these dates, which could
doubtless be corrected by reference to &lsquo;<span lang="it">Notizie

Marforio e di Pasquino,</span>&rsquo; by the same author, Rome, 1789,
which I have not been able to see. Moroni, vi. 99, gives 1791 as the
year in which it was bought by Duke Braschi, the nephew of Pius VI.
while the Pope was in exile in France, and the completion by the
rebuilding must, therefore, have been some years later.</p>

with a comely daughter. Both were well known all over the Rione.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day there came an old gentleman, with a wig and tights,
and a comical old-fashioned dress altogether, and said to the
shopkeeper&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve observed that daughter of yours many
days as I have passed by, and should like to make her my
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great honour for me, Sor

answered the old man; and he said &ldquo;Sor Cassandro&rdquo; like that
because everybody knew old Sor Cassandro with his wig, and his
gold-knobbed stick, and his tights, and his old-fashioned gait.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, as a knowing way of getting out of it,
&ldquo;you see it wouldn&rsquo;t do for a <i>friggitora</i> to marry a
gentleman; a <i>friggitora</i> must marry a
<i>friggitore</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that that need be a

<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand me, Sor
Cassandro,&rdquo; pursued the man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Yes, I understand perfectly,&rdquo; answered
the other. &ldquo;You mean that if she must marry a <i>friggitore</i>,
I must become a <i>friggitore</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;You a <i>friggitore</i>, Sor Cassandro! That
would never do. How could you so demean yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Love makes all sweet,&rdquo; responded Sor
Cassandro. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only to show me what to do and
I&rsquo;ll do it as well as anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The <i>friggitore</i> was something of a wag, and the idea of
the prim little Sor Cassandro turned into a journeyman
<i>friggitore</i> tickled his fancy, and he let him follow his
bent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The next morning Sor Cassandro was at Pan&igrave;co as soon
as the shop was open. They gave him a white jacket and a large white
apron, and put a white cap on his head, with a carnation stuck in it.
And the whole neighbourhood gathered round the shop to see Sor
Cassandro turned into a <i>friggitore</i>. The work of the shop was
increased tenfold, and it was well there was an extra hand to help at
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sor Cassandro was very patient, and adapted himself to his
work surprisingly well, and though the master fryer took a pleasure in
ordering him about, he submitted to all with good grace, and not only
did he make him do the frying and serving out to perfection, but he
even <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>taught him to clip his words and leave off using
any expression that seemed inappropriate to his new station.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8311src" href="#xd26e8311" name=
"xd26e8311src">5</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;There was no denying that Sor Cassandro had become a perfect
<i>friggitore</i>, and no exception could be taken to him on that
score. As soon as he felt himself perfect he did not fail to renew his
suit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The father was puzzled what objection to make next. He knew,
however, that Sor Cassandro was very miserly, so he said,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made yourself a <i>friggitore</i> to please me, now
you must do something to please the girl. Suppose you bring her some
trinkets, if you can spare the price of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Oh, anything for love!&rdquo; answered Sor
Cassandro; and the next day he brought a pair of earrings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;How did she like my earrings?&rdquo; he
whispered next night to her father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Oh, pretty well!&rdquo; replied the father.
&ldquo;You might try something more in that style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The next day he brought her a necklace, the next day a shawl,
and after that he brought fifty scudi to buy clothes such as a girl
should have when she&rsquo;s going to be married.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After all this he asked for the girl herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;You must take her,&rdquo; said the father, and
Sor Cassandro went to take her. But she was a sprightly, impulsive
girl, and the moment he came near her she screamed out&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Get away, horrid old man!&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8339src" href="#xd26e8339" name="xd26e8339src">6</a>
and wouldn&rsquo;t let him approach her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Leave her alone to-night, and try to-morrow.
I&rsquo;ll try to bring her round in the meantime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sor Cassandro came next day; but the girl was more violent
than ever, and would say nothing but &ldquo;Get away, horrid old
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Finding this went on day after day without amendment, Sor
Cassandro indignantly asked for his presents back. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;You shall have them!&rdquo; cried the girl, and
the clothes she tore up to rags, and the trinkets she broke to atoms
and threw them all at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But for the rest of his life, wherever he went, the boys
cried after him, &ldquo;<i>Sor Cassandro, la friggitora! Sor Cassandro,
la friggitora!</i>&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

&lsquo;Friggitoria,&rsquo; an open shop where all manner of fried
dishes very popular among the lower classes, and varying according to
the time of year, are made and sold; three or four or more enormous
pans of oil and of lard are kept boiling, and at one season fish, at
another rice-balls, at another artichokes, &amp;c. &amp;c, always
previously dipped into light batter, are cooked therein to a bright
gold colour. On St. Joseph&rsquo;s Day, as it always falls in Lent, a
meagre festa-dish is made of balls of batter fried in oil, in as
universal request as our pancakes on Shrove Tuesday. A writer in the
&lsquo;Giovedi&rsquo; mentions two popular traditions on the connexion
between the &lsquo;frittelle&rsquo; or &lsquo;frittatelli&rsquo; and
St. Joseph. One is that St. Joseph was wont to make such a dish for his
meal by frying them with the shavings from his bench, in the same
dangerous way that you may see those of his trade heating their glue in
any carpenter&rsquo;s shop in Rome. The other, that on occasion of the
Visitation, the B. Virgin and St. Elizabeth remained so long in
ecstatic conversation that the dinner was forgotten, and St. Joseph
took the liberty allowed to so near a relation of possessing himself of
a frying-pan and preparing a dish of &lsquo;frittelle.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The writer already quoted narrates in another
paper that the &lsquo;friggitori&rsquo; formerly plied their trade in
the open air, but one day a cat escaping from the attentions of an
admirer she did not choose to encourage, sprang from a low roof
adjoining, right into the frying-pan of a &lsquo;<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e8253" title="Source: friggittore">friggitore</span>&rsquo; full
as it was of boiling oil and spluttering &lsquo;frittelle&rsquo;; the
cat overturned the frying-pan, setting herself on fire, and carrying a
panic together with a stream of flaming oil into the midst of the crowd
in waiting for their &lsquo;frittelle.&rsquo; Since that day the
&lsquo;friggitore&rsquo; fries under cover, though still in open
shops.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e8248src">&uarr;</a></p>

<p class="first">This story of Sor Cassandro led to others of the same
nature, but without sufficient interest in the detail to put in print,
though they seemed to illustrate the fact that an imaginative people
will rapidly turn the most ordinary circumstances into a myth. For
instance, one concerned a family named Cocorni, who seem to have been
nothing more than successful grocers, the Twinings of Rome, and here is
a specimen of the language used about them:&mdash;&lsquo;When his
daughter was old enough to marry, <span class="corr" id="xd26e8363"
title="Source: Cocorno">Cocorni</span> would hear of no proposal for
her. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;no one marries my daughter but
he who comes in a carriage and four to fetch her.&rdquo; And it really
did happen that one came in a carriage and four and took her
away;&rsquo; as if it were such a great matter that it implied
something supernatural.</p>

<h2 class="main"><i>THE BEAUTIFUL ENGLISHWOMAN.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a beautiful Englishwoman here once,
beautiful and rich as the sun.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8372src"
href="#xd26e8372" name="xd26e8372src">1</a> Heads without number were
turned by her: but she would have nothing to say to anyone who wanted
to marry her. Some defect she found in all. She was very accomplished,
as well as rich and beautiful, and she drew a picture, and said
&lsquo;When one comes who is like this I will marry him; but no one
else.&rsquo; Some time after a friend came to her, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is So-and-so, he is exactly like the portrait you have
drawn, and is dying to see you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he <i>really</i> like it?&rsquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To me he seems exactly like it; and I don&rsquo;t see he has
any defect at all, except that he has one tooth a little green.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I won&rsquo;t have anything to say to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, if he is exactly like the portrait you have
drawn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He can&rsquo;t be, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have any
defect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he <i>is</i> exactly like it, and so you must see him; if
it&rsquo;s only for curiosity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, for curiosity, then, I&rsquo;ll see him; but
don&rsquo;t let him build any hopes upon it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The friend arranged that they should meet at a ball, and the one was
as well pleased as the other; but not wishing to seem to yield too
soon, she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know, I don&rsquo;t like that green tooth you&rsquo;ve
got.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he, not to appear too easy either, answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, do you know, I don&rsquo;t like that patch<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8407src" href="#xd26e8407" name="xd26e8407src">2</a>
you have on your face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next time they met, neither he had a green tooth, nor had she a
patch; for, you know, a patch can be put on and taken off at pleasure,
and this happened a long long while ago, in the days when they wore
such things.</p>
<p>She then said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you&rsquo;ve put in a false tooth I&rsquo;ll have nothing
to say to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered he; &lsquo;you have taken off your patch;
and I&rsquo;ve taken off my green tooth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could you do that?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! it was only a leaf I put on to see if you were really as
particular as you seemed to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As they were desperately in love with each other, the next thing was
to arrange the marriage secretly. His father had a great title, and
would never have consented to his marrying her, because she had none.
But she had money enough for both; so they contrived a secret marriage.
And then they bought a villa some way off, and lived there.</p>
<p>For thirteen years they lived devoted to each other, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>full of happiness; and two children were born to
them, a boy and a girl. It was only after thirteen years that the
father discovered where the son was, and when he did, he sent for an
assassin,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8428src" href="#xd26e8428" name=
"xd26e8428src">3</a> and giving him plenty of money, told him to go and
by some device or other to bring him to him and get through the affair.
The assassin took a carriage and dressed like a man of some importance,
and said that some chief man or other in the Government had sent for
him to speak to him. The husband suspected nothing, and went with him.
As it was night he could not see which way they drove, and thus he
delivered his son to his father, who kept him shut up in his
palace.</p>
<p>The assassin went back to the villa, and by giving each of the
servants fifty scudi apiece, got access to the wife, and murdered her,
and then took the children to the grandfather&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa, that man killed mama,&rsquo; said the little boy, as
soon as he saw his father.</p>
<p>The husband seized the man, and made him confess it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then now you must kill him who hired you to do it,&rsquo; he
exclaimed. &lsquo;As you have done the one, you must do the other. He
who ordered my wife to be killed is no father to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the assassin went in and killed the father, but when he came out
the husband was ready for him, and he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now your turn has come,&rsquo; and he shot him dead.</p>

<p class="first editorial">[That a rich Englishman should fall in love
with a beautiful but poor Roman girl, and marry her, is no impossible
incident, and may have happened more than once; but it is very curious
to watch how it has passed into the mythology of the people.</p>
<p class="editorial">The idea of a &lsquo;Gran Signore&rsquo; coming on
a visit from a land where all are rich is the first fantastic element
of the tradition. The idea that <i>all</i> English people are rich is
very common among the Roman lower classes, and is not an unnatural
fancy for people to take up who have seen no specimens of the creature
but such as <i>are</i> rich. There is one old woman whom I have never
been able to disabuse of the idea. I shall never forget the blank
astonishment with which she repeated my words the first time I broke it
to her that there were poor people in England, and she has never
thoroughly grasped it.</p>
<p class="editorial">&lsquo;Io pensava che in Inghilterra tutti erano
ricchi&mdash;<i>tutti</i> ricchi&mdash;&rsquo; (I thought
everyone&mdash;<i>everyone</i> in England was rich) she always says, as
if in spite of me she thought so still.</p>
<p class="editorial">That such an one should be won by the charms of a
beautiful Roman girl, and should carry her off to that unknown land
bright with gold but devoid of sun, and that in the end the fogs and
the Protestantism should prove unendurable to the child of the South,
are not bad materials for a fairy story.</p>
<p class="editorial">I have met with such stories several times.</p>
<p class="editorial">One old woman assured me, that when she was a
child her father had let an apartment to the very man, and that he took
the room for a month, and though he spontaneously offered ten times as
high a price as the owner could ever have asked, he never slept there.
He had secretly married a Roman girl who was imprisoned for breaking
the law by marrying a Protestant, and he opened her prison doors with
his &lsquo;<i>wand</i>,&rsquo; that is, he bribed the jailer to admit
him to pass all his time in prison with her; ultimately he carried her
off to England, but she soon died there.</p>
<p class="editorial">Another pointed out to me a shop where in former
days had been a butcher, whose daughter had charmed a rich Englishman,
who carried her off to his own country, and married her there.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>But this was a very <i>tetra</i> (sad, gloomy)
story, for after many years she came back looking like the ghost of
herself. She had gone away a blooming girl, the pride and the
admiration of the whole neighbourhood; she came back prematurely grey,
hollow-eyed, and thin as a skeleton.</p>
<p class="editorial">She said it was the climate had disagreed with
her, and further than that she would say nothing. But who knows what
she may not have had to go through!</p>
<p class="editorial">Bresciani has made the same tradition the
groundwork of one of his most interesting romances.]</p>

"noteref" id="xd26e8493src" href="#xd26e8493" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a rich farmer<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8499src" href="#xd26e8499" name="xd26e8499src">2</a> who had one
only daughter, and she was to be his heiress. She fell in love with a
count who had no money&mdash;at least only ten scudi a month. When he
went to the farmer to ask her in marriage he would not hear of the
alliance, and sent him away.</p>
<p>But the girl and he were bent on the marriage, and this is how they
brought it about. The girl had a thousand scudi of her own; half of
this she gave to him, and said: &lsquo;Go over a certain tract of the
Campagna and visit all the peasants about, and give five piastres to
one and ten to another according to their degree, that they may say
when they are asked that they all belong to Signor Cajusse. Then take
papa round to hear what they say, and he will think you are a great
proprietor, and will let us marry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Signor Cajusse, for such was his name, took the money and did as she
told him, and then hired a carriage and came to her father, and said:
&lsquo;You are quite mistaken in thinking I&rsquo;m too poor to marry
your daughter; come and take a drive with me, and I will show you what
a great man I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the farmer got into his carriage, and he drove <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>him
round to all the peasants he had bribed. First they stopped at a
farm.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8512src" href="#xd26e8512" name=
"xd26e8512src">3</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Signor Cajusse,&rsquo; said the tenant, who had
been duly primed, bowing down to the ground; and then he began to tell
him about his crops, as if he had been really proprietor.</p>
<p>After this he proposed to walk a little way, and all the labourers
left their work and flocked after him, crying, &lsquo;Good day, Signor
Cajusse; health to you and long life, and may God prosper you!&rsquo;
and they tried to kiss his hand.</p>
<p>Further along they came to a villa where Cajusse had ascertained
that the real proprietor would not come that day. Here he went straight
up to the casino, where the servant in charge, who had been also duly
bribed, received him with all the honours due to a master.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Welcome, Signor Cajusse,&rsquo; he said, and opened the doors
and shutters and set the chairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bring a little of that fine eight-year-old wine,&rsquo;
ordered Cajusse; &lsquo;we have brought a packet of biscuits, and will
have some luncheon.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8525src" href=
"#xd26e8525" name="xd26e8525src">4</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good, Signor Cajusse,&rsquo; replied the servant
respectfully, and shortly after brought in a bottle of wine handed to
him for the purpose by Cajusse the day before. When they had drunk they
took a stroll round the place, and wherever they turned the labourers
all had a greeting and a blessing for Signor Cajusse.</p>
<p>When the merchant saw all this he hardly knew how to forgive himself
for having run the risk of losing such a son-in-law. He was all smiles
and civility as they drove home, and the next day was as anxious to
hurry on the match as he had been before to put it off. As all were
equally in a hurry to have it, of course it was not long before it was
celebrated. With the girl&rsquo;s remaining five hundred scudi a
handsome apartment was hired to satisfy appearances before the parents,
and for a few days they lived on what was left over. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span></p>
<p>They sat counting their last two or three scudi. &lsquo;What is to
be done now?&rsquo; said Cajusse; &lsquo;that will soon be spent, and
then how are we to live?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll set it right,&rsquo; answered the bride.
&lsquo;Now we&rsquo;re married that&rsquo;s all that signifies. Now
it&rsquo;s done they can&rsquo;t help it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So she went to her mother and told her all, and the good woman,
knowing the thing could not be altered, talked over the father; and he
gave them something to live upon and found a place for Cajusse, and
they were very happy.</p>

her station, and he took all the pains imaginable to prevent them from
meeting; so much so that he scarcely left her out of his sight. One day
he was obliged to go to his vineyard outside the gates, and before he
left he gave strict injunctions to his servant to let no one in till he
came back at 21 o&rsquo;clock.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8548src"
href="#xd26e8548" name="xd26e8548src">2</a></p>
<p>It was an hour before 21 o&rsquo;clock, and there was a knock at the
door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is the Count Lattanzio in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, he won&rsquo;t be in just yet.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I know, he won&rsquo;t be in till 21 o&rsquo;clock; he
said I was to wait. I&rsquo;m come to measure him for a pair of new
boots.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8560src" href="#xd26e8560" name=
"xd26e8560src">3</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;If he told you to wait I suppose you must,&rsquo; said the
servant; &lsquo;otherwise he had told me not to let anyone in.&rsquo;
And as he showed him in he thought he was a rather gentlemanly
bootmaker.</p>
<p>Soon after there was another knock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is the Count Lattanzio in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, he won&rsquo;t be in for some time yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, never mind; he said I was to wait if he hadn&rsquo;t come
in. I&rsquo;m the tailor, come to measure him for a new
suit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If he said you were to wait I suppose you must,&rsquo;
answered the servant; &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s very odd he should have
told you so, as he particularly told me to let no one in.&rsquo;
However, he showed him in also. Directly after there came another
knock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is the Count Lattanzio at home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, he won&rsquo;t be in for some time yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind; I&rsquo;m the lawyer engaged in his cause before
the courts. He said I was to wait if he wasn&rsquo;t in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the servant began to get alarmed at having to disobey orders so
many times, and he thought he would make a stand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but master said
I wasn&rsquo;t to show anyone in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! when I&rsquo;ve come here with my two clerks, on
particular business of the greatest importance to your master, do you
suppose I&rsquo;m going away again like that, fellow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The servant was so amazed by his imperative manner that he let him
in, too.</p>
<p>Twenty-one o&rsquo;clock came at last, and with it Count Lattanzio.
Having given orders that no one should be let <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>in,
of course he expected to find no one. What was his astonishment,
therefore, when, as he opened the drawing-room door, a loud cry of
&lsquo;Long live Count Lattanzio!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8594src" href="#xd26e8594" name="xd26e8594src">4</a> uttered by
several voices, met his ear.</p>
<p>The shoemaker was the bridegroom, the tailor the best man, the
lawyer and his two clerks were the notary and his witnesses. The
marriage articles had been duly drawn up and signed, and as the parties
were of age there was no rescinding the contract.</p>
<p>Count Lattanzio sent away the servant for not attending to orders;
but that made no difference&mdash;the deed was done.</p>

<p class="first">There was once a pleader<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8607src" href="#xd26e8607" name="xd26e8607src">1</a> who sat
writing in his room all day whenever he was not in court.</p>
<p>One day as he so sat there came in at the window a large monkey, and
began whisking about the room. The lawyer, pleased with the antics of
the monkey, called it <i lang="it">scimmia bellacuccia</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8615src" href="#xd26e8615" name="xd26e8615src">2</a>
and caressed and fed it. By-and-by he had to go out on his business,
and though he was in some fear of the pranks the monkey might be up to
in his absence, he had taken such a fancy to it that he did not like to
send it away, and at last left it alone in his apartment. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span></p>
<p>When he came home, instead of the monkey having been at any
mischievous pranks, the whole suite of rooms was put in beautiful
order, and out of very scanty materials in the cupboard an excellent
dinner was cooked and laid ready.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i lang="it">Scimmia bellacuccia!</i> is this your
doing!&rsquo; said the lawyer, and the monkey nodded assent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you are a precious monkey, indeed,&rsquo; he replied,
and he called it to him and fed it, and gave it part of the dinner.</p>
<p>The next day the monkey did the work of the house, and the lawyer
sent away his servant because he had no further need for one, the
monkey did all much better and in a more intelligent way.</p>
<p>All went well for a time, when one day the lawyer had occasion to
visit a friar he knew at St. Nicol&ograve; da Tolentino, for in those
days there were friars<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8632src" href=
"#xd26e8632" name="xd26e8632src">3</a> there instead of nuns as now. He
did not fail to tell him of the treasure he had found in his
<i>bellacuccia</i>, as he called his monkey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let yourself be deceived, friend!&rsquo;
exclaimed the friar. &lsquo;This is no monkey; it is not in the nature
of a monkey to do thus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come and see it yourself,&rsquo; said the lawyer. &lsquo;You
will find I have over-stated nothing of what it can do and does every
day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some days after this the friar came, having taken care to provide
himself with his stole and a stoup of holy water. Directly he came into
the lawyer&rsquo;s apartment he put on his stole and sprinkled the holy
water.</p>
<p>The monkey no sooner saw the shadow of his habit than it took to
flight, and, after scrambling all round the room to get away from the
sight of him, finally hid itself under the bed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see!&rsquo; said the friar to the lawyer.</p>
<p>But the lawyer cried, &lsquo;Here <i>bellacuccia</i>; come
here!&rsquo; and as the monkey was by habit very docile and obedient,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>when he had said
&lsquo;<i>bellacuccia</i>&rsquo; a great many times, it at last forced
itself to come to him, but stealthily and warily, showing great fear of
the monk.</p>
<p>When it had got quite close to the lawyer, and he was holding it,
the friar once more put on his stole, sprinkled it with holy water and
exorcised it.</p>
<p>Instantly <i>bellacuccia</i> burst away from the lawyer, and,
clambering up to the window, broke away through the upper panes and
disappeared, leaving a smoke and a smell of brimstone behind. But it
was really a man who had been put under a spell by evil arts,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8666src" href="#xd26e8666" name="xd26e8666src">4</a>
and when thus released by the monk&rsquo;s exorcism he went and became
a monk, I forget in what order, but I know it was one of those who
dress in white.</p>

&lsquo;Scimmia,&rsquo; a monkey. In England we usually speak of a cat
as of feminine gender, and in Germany the custom is so strong that the
well-known riddle pronounces the &lsquo;Kater&rsquo; (tom cat)
&lsquo;keine Katze&rsquo; (no cat), while in France, Spain and Italy
the normal cat is masculine. In Italian, on the other hand, the monkey
is always spoken of in the feminine gender; it becomes noteworthy in
this instance when we consider the termination of the story.

<p class="first">There was once a great king who had one only little
daughter, and this daughter was always entreating him to take her out
hunting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not proper for little girls to go out hunting,&rsquo;
he used to say; but it was no use. She went on begging all the same,
and at last her importunity gained the day, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>he
took her with him. But in the forest she got separated from him and
lost herself, and he, full of the ardour of the chase, forgot the care
of her, and, when he came to think of her, she could no more be
found.</p>
<p>She wandered about the forest crying for her father, but her father
came not; and instead of her father a <i>selvaggio</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8687src" href="#xd26e8687" name="xd26e8687src">1</a>
found her, and fell in love with her, and took her to his den and
married her, and she had two children.</p>
<p>When ten years had passed, and there were no tidings of her, the
queen, her mother, died of a broken heart.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8692src" href="#xd26e8692" name="xd26e8692src">2</a></p>
<p>But the <i lang="it">selvaggio</i> loved her dearly, and did
everything in his power to give her pleasure. When he found she could
not eat the raw game which he brought her, he would go into the towns
and steal cooked food and bring it to her, and when he could not get
that he would go ever so far to find fruits and roots. Everything, he
did to please her, but it was no use, she could not love him.</p>
<p>At last, however, after so many years were passed, he thought she
was at least used to the way of life with him, and he no longer watched
her so closely. One day when he was gone to a long distance she
wandered on to a cliff that overhung the sea, and looked till she saw a
ship, then she called to it and made signs to it to come and pick her
up.</p>
<p>The captain took compassion on her distress, and made for the land,
and took her on board and wrapped her in a cloak,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8707src" href="#xd26e8707" name="xd26e8707src">3</a> and she told
him who she was and he promised to take her home. He gave her a white
kerchief to put on her head and another to hold in her hand.</p>
<p>They had not got far out to sea when the <i lang="it">selvaggio</i>
found out what had happened, and came running to the same cliff where
she had stood, and made signs entreating her to come back; but she
shook the handkerchief she held in token of refusal.</p>
<p>Then what did he do? He ran back to the den and fetched one of the
children and held it up, appealing to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>her mother&rsquo;s
instincts; but she always continued waving the handkerchief in token of
refusal. When he saw that this prevailed not, he ran back to the den
and fetched the other child, and held them both up to plead with her to
come back. But she always, and always, went on waving the handkerchief
in token of refusal. Then what did he do? He took out his knife and
plunged it into the one child, as signifying that if she did not come
back he would kill the other also. But even for that she was not moved,
but went on waving the handkerchief in token of refusal. Then with his
knife he killed the other child, for he had no hope left; but she could
not go back to that life with him, and went on waving the handkerchief
in token of refusal.</p>
<p>Then with his claw<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8724src" href=
"#xd26e8724" name="xd26e8724src">4</a> he tore open his breast, and
tore out his heart, and died for the love he bore her.</p>
<p>But the sailors took her home, and they were richly rewarded, and
there was great rejoicing.</p>

&lsquo;You know what a &ldquo;selvaggio&rdquo; is, I suppose?&rsquo;
asked the narrator. &lsquo;Yes; a wild man,&rsquo; I answered, thinking
of the German myths. &lsquo;No, they weren&rsquo;t altogether men, they
were those creatures there used to be in old times, half men with legs
like goats, but they walked on two legs, and had heads and arms like
men.&rsquo; After this description, I thought I might take the license
of adopting the title for a word incidentally used by the narrator in
telling the story. The shepherds and goatherds about Rome with their
goatskin leggings covering leg and thigh, readily suggest to the eye
how the idea of a satyr may have first arisen.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

<p class="first">They say there was a queen whose husband was dead, and
she had one only son. Imagine how devoted she was to him, her only
child, soon to be the king of vast dominions.</p>
<p>One day a lady, unknown to her, came and asked if she might put a
horse of hers in her stable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the queen; &lsquo;I cannot have the horses of
anyone else mixed up there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lady turned to go; but as she went, she met the prince coming in
from hunting, surrounded by all his suite. The lady was a fairy, and in
her indignation at the queen&rsquo;s refusal of her demand, she turned
the prince and all those following him into <i>salvatichi</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8755src" href="#xd26e8755" name=
"xd26e8755src">1</a></p>
<p>Imagine the horror and the cries of the queen when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>she
saw what had happened. What was to be done? Much as she adored her son,
it was impossible to keep him in the palace now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must put him in the stables,&rsquo; said the cruel fairy,
who had waited to enjoy her revenge, and now preserved her coolness
amid the confusion and excitement of those around. &lsquo;You must put
him in the stables, and all the others too now. Your stables will be
full enough, indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the queen&rsquo;s grief was too deep to waste itself in a strife
of words with her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is only one mode of redemption for him. If he can find
a maiden to consent to marry him as he is, without knowing he is a
prince, I will come and remove the spell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The queen had seen the proof of her relentless spirit, and knew it
would be vain if she should humble herself to entreat her to alter her
sentence. So she said nothing, and the fairy went away.</p>
<p>To find a maiden who should consent to marry such a monster as her
son now was, and who should yet be meet to be his wife when restored to
his due estate, was a hopeless task indeed; but what will not a
mother&rsquo;s love attempt? With endless fatigue and continued
mortifications she made the fruitless effort in every quarter. When
this had utterly failed, she condescended to maidens of lower estate,
and tried daughters of merchants and tradesmen, and even peasants, to
whom the elevation of rank might in some measure compensate the
ill-conditioned union. But it was all in vain, there were only fresh
repulses and deeper mortifications.</p>
<p>It happened that adjoining the paddock in which the stables lay,
were the grounds of a duke. One day the duke&rsquo;s daughter was
walking in her garden, and the prince immediately turned his head and
saw her, and began beckoning to her, for he had the head and arms and
body of a man from the waist upwards still, and the rest of him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>was like the hindquarters of a goat, only he
stood upright, like a man. The duke&rsquo;s daughter was perplexed,
however, at the sight of such a monster, and ran away.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the next day she came back, and the prince beckoned to
her again, and all his suite, who were satyrs like himself, beckoned to
her too, till at last she came near.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you wish me well?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8781src" href="#xd26e8781" name="xd26e8781src">2</a> he
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; exclaimed the duke&rsquo;s daughter with disgust,
because she could not say that she loved him: and she ran away. Every
day it was the same thing; and when she told her mother what had
happened, she bid her keep away, and beware of going near such a
monster.</p>
<p>For a whole month, therefore, she kept away; but curiosity overcame
her at last, and she went down into the garden as before. All the
satyrs began beckoning as usual, and she went up to them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will say you wish me well, you will give me endless
happiness,&rsquo; said the prince; &lsquo;and if not, I will dash my
head against this wall, and put an end to my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was so much in earnest, and the tears were in his eyes, and his
sighs and entreaties were so moving, that she almost forgot his
monstrous form. The prince observed that her face betrayed signs of
interest, and he redoubled his sighs, and all the other satyrs made
signs and gesticulations to her that she should consent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say you wish me well! Let me just have the happiness of once
hearing you say so!&rsquo; continued the prince.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor fellow, he seems so sad, and so anxious I should just
say it once. There can&rsquo;t be much harm in saying just once that I
wish him well,&rsquo; said the maiden to herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say, say just once, that you wish me well!&rsquo; persisted
the prince; and the maiden in her compassion said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes! I wish you well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Immediately the fairy appeared and took the spell from off the
prince, and from off all his suite. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the duke&rsquo;s daughter found to what a fine handsome prince

after her too. And <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321"
name="pb321">321</a>]</span>when she found that he was not deterred by
the sight, she turned and killed him in like manner.</p>
<p>Only fancy what a woman she must have been!</p>
<p>When her husband, who had liked her before, saw this, he began to be
afraid of her; nevertheless, they lived for some time happily together,
and had two beautiful children. But after that again, her
husband&rsquo;s love cooled towards her when he thought of the horrors
she had committed, and he took their two children and went away and
left her.</p>
<p>After a time Amadea not only found out where he was, but found out
that she had a rival. Then she made her way to the place, and demanded
to see her rival; but knowing of what she was capable, this her husband
would by no means allow. Then she prepared a most beautiful necklace of
pearls, and sent it as a present to her rival. But she had poisoned it
by her arts, for she was a sort of witch, and when her rival put it on
she died.</p>
<p>Meantime she had sent a message to her husband, saying, &lsquo;If I
may not come to your court, at least let me see my children for one
hour, and then I will go away, and molest you no more for
ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>That</i> I will grant you,&rsquo; was his answer; and the
children were brought to her.</p>
<p>When she saw her children, she wept, and embraced them, and wept
again, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, my children, I must kill you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why must you kill us?&rsquo; asked the little boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because of the too great love I bear you,&rsquo; she replied,
and drew out her dagger.</p>
<p>At that instant her husband came into the room, and she stabbed the
children before his eyes. After that she stabbed herself, and he died
of grief.</p>
<p class="editorial">[It was about the time that Prince Amadeo gave up
his attempt to hold the throne of Spain that I was visiting a poor
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=

stories of this collection. The abdication of Prince Amadeo being the
subject of the hour, we, of course, talked about that; when she said:
&lsquo;Ah, you who are so fond of <i>favola</i>, do you know the
<i>favola</i> of Queen Amadea, for one name brings up another?&rsquo; I
told her I did not; for I expected she meant some legend of the House
of Savoy; she then told me the story of Medeia in the text. It is very
rare, however, to meet remnants of classical traditions in such direct

<h2 class="main"><i>THE KING OF PORTUGAL.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They say that once there was a king of Portugal who
had a beautiful daughter, and there came a prince to marry her. When
the prince saw how old and feeble the king was, he seized him, and shut
him up in prison, and ordered him to be fed on only bread and water,
that he might die without killing him. &lsquo;And then,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;I shall take the government.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he would send and ask, &lsquo;How does he look today? Does he
grow lean and pale? Does he look like to die?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the answer ever was, &lsquo;Nay, prince, he looks hale and
stout. Every day his face is fresher and fatter. Every day he seems
stronger and firmer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the prince grew in despair of ever accomplishing his design,
and he said, &lsquo;It cannot be as you say, unless there is
treachery,&rsquo; and he changed the guards, and set a watch upon them;
but the same thing happened, and the old king continued to grow stouter
and stronger. He made them search the princess, too, when she went to
see her father, and they assured themselves that she took nothing to
him. Then he bade them watch her, and they saw that she placed her
breast against the prison bars, and fed him with her own milk.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span></p>
<p>For it had been thus, that when she learnt what was the design of
the prince, she was filled with earnest desire to save her
father&rsquo;s life, and prayed so hard that she might have wherewith
to support him, that, young girl as she was, the means was afforded
her, and thus by her devotion she preserved him in life and health.</p>
<p>When the prince heard what she did, he was seized with compunction,
and sent and released the king, and restored him to his throne, and
went his way in shame. But the king sent for him back, and forgave him:
he gave him his daughter also, and when he died he left him the
succession to the kingdom.</p>
<p class="editorial">[&lsquo;I have no &ldquo;favole&rdquo; for you
to-day,&rsquo; was one day my greeting from an old lady who had given
me many, &lsquo;but there has just come to mind a &ldquo;bell&rsquo;
fatto&rdquo; (a grand deed), which is better than a
&ldquo;favola&rdquo; for it is historic truth.&rsquo; Then she told me
the story in the text, and I was surprised to find she was positive it
was a king of Portugal and that she never seemed to have heard of the
&lsquo;Carit&agrave; Romana.&rsquo; It is odd that while so many
legends get localised any should get dis-localised.] <span class=

"xd26e8878src" href="#xd26e8878" name="xd26e8878src">1</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Two friars once went out on a journey, that is to say,
a friar and a lay brother.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8882src" href=
"#xd26e8882" name="xd26e8882src">2</a> One day of their journey, when
they were far from their convent, the friar said to the lay brother:
&lsquo;We fare poorly enough all the days of our life in our convent,
let us, for one day of our lives, taste the good things of this world
which others enjoy every day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know better than I, who am only a poor simple lay
brother,&rsquo; answered the other, &lsquo;whether such a thing may be
done. I don&rsquo;t mean to say I should not like to have a jolly good
dinner for once; but there is the uneasiness of conscience to spoil the
feast, and the penance afterwards. I think we had better leave it
alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They journeyed on, therefore, and said no more about it that day,
but the next, when they were very hungry after a long walk through the
cold mountain air, the scent of the viands preparing in the inn as they
drew near brought the subject of yesterday&rsquo;s conversation to
their minds again, and the friar said to the lay brother: &lsquo;You
know even our rule says that when we are journeying we cannot live as
we do in our convent; we must eat and drink whatever we find in the
places to which we are sent; moreover, some relaxation is allowed for
the restoration of the body under the fatigues of the journey. Now, if
we come, as it has often happened to us, to a poor little mountain
village, where scarcely a wholesome crust of bread is to be found, to
be washed down with a glass of sour wine, we have to take it for all
our dinner, and eat it with thanksgiving. Therefore why, now, when we
come to a place where the fare is less scanty, even as by the odours we
perceive is the case <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328"
name="pb328">328</a>]</span>here, should we not also take what is found
ready, and eat it with thanksgiving?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What you say seems right and just enough,&rsquo; said the lay
brother, not at all sorry to have his scruples so speciously explained
away. &lsquo;But there is one thing you have not thought of. It is all
very well to say we will eat and drink this and that, but how are we
poor friars, who possess nothing, to command the delicacies which are
smoking round the fire, and which have to be paid for by well-stored
purses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! that is not the difficulty,&rsquo; replied the friar;
&lsquo;leave that to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time they had reached the threshold of the inn, and, taking
his companion&rsquo;s last feeble resistance for consent, the friar
strutted into the eating-room with so bold an air that the lay brother
hardly knew him for the humble religious he had been accompanying
anon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ho! here! John, Peter, Francis, whatever you are
called!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Francesco, to your service,&rsquo; replied the host humbly,
thinking by his commanding tone he must be some son of a great
family.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Francesco <i>guercino</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8906src" href="#xd26e8906" name="xd26e8906src">3</a> then,&rsquo;
continued the friar in the same high-sounding voice, &lsquo;take away
this foul table-cloth, and bring the cleanest and finest in your house;
remove these cloudy glasses and bring out the bright ones you have
there locked up in the glass case, and replace these bone spoons and
forks<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8909src" href="#xd26e8909" name=
"xd26e8909src">4</a> with the silver ones out of your strong
box.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your Excellency is served!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8914src" href="#xd26e8914" name="xd26e8914src">5</a> said the
host, who, as well as his wife and son, had bustled so fast to do what
he was so peremptorily ordered that all was done as soon as spoken.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now then Francesco <i>guercino</i>, what have you got to put
before a hungry gentleman in this poor little place of yours?&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Excellenza! when you have tasted the cooking of my poor
little house,&rsquo; said the host, &lsquo;you will not, I am sure, be
displeased; all unworthy as it is of your Excellency&rsquo;s palate.
For what we have ready, we have beef for our boiled meat, good brains
for our fried, the plumpest poultry for our grilled, and the freshest
eggs for our omelette; or, if your Excellency prefers it, we have
hashed turkey, with crisp watercresses; and as for our soup,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8926src" href="#xd26e8926" name="xd26e8926src">6</a>
there is not an inn in the whole province can beat us, I know. And for
dessert we have cheese and fruits, and&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done, Francesco <i lang="it">guercino</i>,&rsquo; said
the friar interrupting him. &lsquo;You know how to cry your own wares,
at all events. Bring us the best of what you have; it is not for poor
friars to complain of what is set before us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The last sentence gave the host a high idea of the piety of his
guest just as the hectoring tone he had assumed had convinced him he
must be high-born, and in a trice the best of everything in the house
was made ready for the table of the friar. All other guests had to
wait, or go away unserved; the host was intent only on serving the
friar.</p>
<p>Every dish he took to the table himself, and as he did so each time
the friar, fixing on him a look of sanctity, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blessed Francesco! Blessed Francesco!&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8962src" href="#xd26e8962" name=
"xd26e8962src">7</a></p>
<p>At the close of the meal, as he was hovering about the table,
nervously wiping away a crumb, or polishing a plate, he said, with
trembling:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excellenza! Permit a poor man to put one question. What is
there you see about me that makes you look at me as though you saw
happiness in store, and exclaim with so much unction as quite to fill
me with joy, &ldquo;Blessed Francesco!&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True, something I see wherefore I call thee blessed,&rsquo;
replied the friar; &lsquo;but I cannot tell it thee now. To-morrow,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>perhaps, I may find it easier. Impossible now,
friend. Now, pray thee, show us our rooms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It needed not to add any injunctions concerning the rooms; of
course, the cleanest and the best were appointed by Francesco
spontaneously for such honoured guests.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you think we are getting on?&rsquo; said the friar to
the lay brother when they were alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excellently well so far,&rsquo; replied the other;
&lsquo;things have passed my lips this night which never have they
tasted before, nor ever may again. But the reckoning, the reckoning;
that is what puzzles me: when it comes to paying the bill,
what&rsquo;ll you do then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leave it all to me,&rsquo; returned the friar;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite satisfied with the man we have to deal with. It
will all come right, never fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next morning the two brothers were astir betimes, but Francesco
was on the look-out to serve them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excellenza! you will not leave without breakfast,
Excellenza!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Francesco; poor friars must not mind going without
breakfast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, from my house, Excellenza!&rsquo; responded Francesco.
&lsquo;I have the table ready with a bottle of wine freshly drawn from
the cellar, eggs that were born<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8990src"
href="#xd26e8990" name="xd26e8990src">8</a> since daylight, only
waiting your appearance to be boiled, rolls this moment drawn from the
oven, and my wife is at the stove preparing a fried dish<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8993src" href="#xd26e8993" name="xd26e8993src">9</a>
fit for a king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too much, too much, Francesco! You spoil us; we are not used
to such things,&rsquo; said the lay brother as they sat down; but
Francesco had flown into the kitchen, and returned with the dish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blessed Francesco!&rsquo; said the friar as he set it on the
table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not disturb your Excellency now,&rsquo; said
Francesco; &lsquo;but, after you have breakfasted, I crave your
remembrance of your promise of last night, that you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>would reveal to me this morning wherefore you
say with such enthusiasm &ldquo;Blessed
Francesco!&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not time to speak of it now,&rsquo; said the friar;
&lsquo;first we have our reckoning to make.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lay brother hid his face in his table-napkin in terror, and
seemed to be seized with a distressing fit of coughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t speak of the reckoning, Excellenza; that is
as nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said the friar; &lsquo;that must not be;&rsquo;
and he made a gesture as if he would have drawn out a purse, while
under the table he had to press his feet against those of the lay
brother to silence his rising remonstrance for his persistence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of taking anything from your
Excellenza,&rsquo; persisted the host, putting his hands behind him
that no money might be forced upon him.</p>
<p>The more stedfastly he refused the more perseveringly the friar
continued to press the payment, till, with his companion, he had gained
the threshold of the door.</p>
<p>As they were passing out, however, the host once more exclaimed,
&lsquo;But the explanation your Excellency was to give me of why you
said &ldquo;Blessed Francesco!&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Impossible, friend; I cannot tell it here. Wait till I have
gained the height of yonder mound, while you stand at its foot, and I
will tell it you from thence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this they parted.</p>
<p>When the friar and his companion had reached the height he had
pointed out, and were at a sufficient distance to be saved the fear of
pursuit, he turned to the host, who stood gaping at the bottom, and
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucky for you, Francesco, that when you come to die you will
only have the trouble of shutting one eye, instead of two, like other
men.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9027src" href="#xd26e9027" name=

<p class="editorial">[Such a story at the expense of a single unworthy
monk contains no implied taunt at the religious orders, who are deeply
honoured in Rome, and none more than the mendicant Franciscans, most of
whom are themselves of the very people. Ever since the invasion of
September 20, 1870, every effort has been used to stir up the people
against them, but with little effect. At the last Carneval the most
elaborate car was got up with the purpose of ridiculing them, but it
met with no approval, except from members of the clubs. The narrator of
the story was herself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href=

<h2 class="main"><i>THE PREFACE OF A FRANCISCAN.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A Franciscan friar was travelling on business of his
order when he was overtaken by three brigands, who stole from him his
ass, his saddle, and his doubloons. Moreover, they told him that if he
informed any man of what they had done they would certainly come after
him again and take his life; for they could only sell the ass and the
saddle that were known to be his by representing that he had sold them
to them, otherwise no one would have bought them.</p>
<p>The friar told no man what had happened to him, for fear of losing
his life; yet he knew that if he could only let his parishioners know
what had occurred, they would soon retake for him all that he had
lost.</p>
<p>So he hit on the following expedient: next Sunday, as he was saying
Mass, when he came to the place in the Preface where special additions
commemorative of the particular festivals are inserted, after the
enumeration of the praises of God, he added the words,
&lsquo;Nevertheless, me, Thy poor servant, evil men have robbed of my
ass and her saddle, and all my doubloons; but to no man have I declared
the thing, save unto Thee only, Omnipotent Father, who knowest all
things, and helpest the poor;&rsquo; and then he went on,
&lsquo;<span lang="la">et ide&ograve; cum angelis et
archangelis,</span>&rsquo; &amp;c.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9064src"
href="#xd26e9064" name="xd26e9064src">1</a></p>
<p>The parishioners were no sooner thus informed of what had occurred,
than they went after the brigands and made them give up all they had
taken. The next time, therefore, the father was out in the Campagna,
the brigands came after him and said: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb334" href="#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, we take your life; last time we let you off, saying we
would spare you if you told no man what we had done; but you cannot
keep your own counsel, so you must die like the rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the good monk showed them that he had not spoken to man of the
thing, but had only lamented his loss before God, which every man was
free to do. And the brigands, when they heard that, could say nothing,

familiarity with sacred matters, and are told with genuine fun without
the least infusion of irreverence. Just as out of the fulness of the
heart the mouth speaks, even so we make jokes on whatever subject we
are most occupied with. Religious offices are so much a part of the
daily life of the Catholic poor that it would be impossible to banish
the language of them from their simple jokes. I have had numbers of

<h2 class="main"><i>THE LENTEN PREACHER.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A friar came to preach the Lenten sermons in a country
place. The wife of a rich peasant sat under the pulpit, and thought all
the time what a nice-looking man he was, instead of listening to his
exhortations to penance.</p>
<p>When the sermon was over she went home and took out half-a-dozen
nice fine pocket-handkerchiefs, and sent them to him by her maid, with
a very civil note to beg him to come and see her. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span></p>
<p>As the maid was going out, the husband met her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>The maid, who did not at all like her errand, promised if he would
not be angry with her, and would not let her mistress know it, she
would tell him all.</p>
<p>The husband promised to hold her harmless, and she gave him the
handkerchiefs and the note.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come here,&rsquo; said the husband; and he took her into his
room and wrote a note as if from the friar, saying he was much obliged
by her presents, and would like to see the lady very much, but that it
was impossible they could meet, so she must not think of it. This note
the maid took back to her mistress as if from the friar.</p>
<p>A few days after this the husband gave out that he would have to go
to a fair, and would be away two or three days. Immediately the wife
took a pound of the best snuff and sent it as a present to the friar by
the same maid with another note, saying the husband was going away on
such an evening, and if he then came to see her at an hour after the
Ave he would find the door open. This also the maid took to her master;
the husband took the snuff and wrote an answer, as if from the friar,
to say he would keep the appointment. In the evening he said good-bye
to his wife, and went away. But he went to the butcher and bought a
stout beef sinew, and at the hour appointed for the friar, he came back
dressed as a friar, and beat her with the beef sinew till she was half
dead. Then he went down in the kitchen and sent the servant up to heal
her, and went away for three days. When he came back the wife was still
doubled up, and suffering from the beating.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; he said, sympathisingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! I fell down the cellar stairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean by leaving your mistress to go down to the
cellar?&rsquo; he cried out to the servant, with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>great solicitude. &lsquo;How can you allow her
to do such things? What&rsquo;s the use of you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t scold the servant,&rsquo; answered the wife;
&lsquo;it wasn&rsquo;t her fault. I shall be all right soon.&rsquo; And
she made as light of her ailment as she could, to keep him from asking
her any more questions. But he was discreet enough to say no more.</p>
<p>Only when she was well again he sent to the friar and asked him to
come home to dine with them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My wife is subject to odd fancies sometimes,&rsquo; he said,
as they walked home. &lsquo;If she should do anything extravagant,
don&rsquo;t you mind; I shall be there to call her to order.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he told the servant to bring in the soup and the boiled meat
without waiting for orders, but to keep the grill back till he came to
the kitchen door to call her.</p>
<p>At the time for the grill, therefore, he got up from table to go and
call her, and thus left his wife and the friar alone together. They
were no sooner alone than she got up, and calling him a horrid friar,
gave him a sound drubbing. The husband came back in time to prevent
mischief, and to make excuses; and finding she was cured of her
affection, said no more of the affair.</p>

<p class="first">A countryman was going along driving a pig before him.
&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have a bit of fun with that fellow,&rsquo; said the
brother porter of a monastery to the father guardian,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e9124src" href="#xd26e9124" name="xd26e9124src">2</a> as they
saw him coming along the road. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll call his pig an ass,
and of course he&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s a pig; then I shall laugh at
him for not knowing better, and he will grow angry. Then I&rsquo;ll
say, &ldquo;Well, will you have the father guardian to settle the
dispute? and if he decides I&rsquo;m right I shall keep the beast for
myself.&rdquo; Then you come and say it is an ass, and we&rsquo;ll keep
it.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span></p>
<p>The father guardian agreed, with a hearty laugh; and as soon as the
countryman came up the brother porter did all as he had arranged.</p>
<p>The countryman was so sure of his case that he willingly submitted
to the arbitration of the father guardian; but great was his dismay
when the father guardian decided against him, and he had to go home
without his pig.</p>
<p>But what did the countryman do? He dressed himself up as a poor
girl, and about nightfall, and a storm coming on, he rang at the bell
of the monastery and entreated the charity of shelter for the
night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo; said the brother porter; &lsquo;we
can&rsquo;t have any womenkind in here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the dark, and the storm!&rsquo; clamoured the pretended
girl; &lsquo;think of that. You can&rsquo;t leave me out here all
alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rsquo; said the porter, &lsquo;but the
thing&rsquo;s impossible. I can&rsquo;t do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The good father guardian, hearing the dispute at that unusual hour,
put his head out of the window and asked what it was all about.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a difficult case, brother porter,&rsquo; he said when
he had heard the girl&rsquo;s request. &lsquo;If we take her in we
infringe our rule in one way; if we leave her exposed to every kind of
peril we sin against its spirit in another direction. I only see one
way out of it. I can&rsquo;t send her into any of your cells; but I
will let her pass the night in mine, provided she is content not to
undress, and will consent to sit up in a chair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was exactly what the countryman wanted, therefore he gave a
ready assent, and the father guardian took him up into his cell. The
pretended girl sat up in a chair quietly enough through the dark of the
night, but when morning began to dawn, out came a stick that had been
hidden under the petticoats, and whack, whack<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9146src" href="#xd26e9146" name="xd26e9146src">3</a>&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>fine drubbing the poor father guardian got, to
the tune of&mdash;&lsquo;So you think I don&rsquo;t know a pig from an
ass, do you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he had well bruised him all over, the countryman made the best
of his way downstairs, and off and away he was before anyone could
catch him.</p>
<p>The next day what did he do? He dressed up like a doctor, and came
round asking if anyone had any ailments to cure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s just the thing for us,&rsquo; said the brother
porter to himself as he saw him come by. &lsquo;The father guardian was
afraid to let the doctor of the neighbourhood attend him, for fear of
the scandal of all the story coming out; the strange doctor will just
do, as there is no need to tell him anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The countryman in his new disguise, therefore, was taken up to the
father guardian&rsquo;s cell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing very much the matter,&rsquo; he said
when he had examined the wounds and bruises; &lsquo;it might all be set
right in a day by a certain herb,&rsquo; which he named.</p>
<p>The herb was a difficult one to find, but as it was so important to
get the father guardian cured immediately, before any inquiry should be
raised as to the cause of his sufferings, the whole community set out
to wander over the Campagna in search of it.</p>
<p>As soon as they were a good way off, the pretended doctor took out a
thick stick which he held concealed under his long robe, and whack,
whack&mdash;belaboured the poor father guardian more terribly even than
before, to the tune of&mdash;&lsquo;So you think I don&rsquo;t know an
ass from a pig, do you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>How far soever the brothers were gone, his cries were so piteous
that they recalled them, but not till the countryman had made good his
escape.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have sinned, my brethren,&rsquo; said the father guardian
when they were all gathered round him; &lsquo;and I have suffered
justly for it. We had no right to take the man&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>pig,
even for a joke. Let it now, therefore, be restored to him, and in
amends let there be given him along with it an ass also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the countryman got his pig back, and a donkey into the
bargain.</p>

<p class="first">Seven clodhoppers went to confession.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father, I stole something,&rsquo; said the first.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was it you stole?&rsquo; asked the priest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some <i>mistuanza</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9191src"
href="#xd26e9191" name="xd26e9191src">2</a> because I was
starving,&rsquo; replied the country bumpkin.</p>
<p>That the poor fellow, who really looked as if he might have been
starving, should have stolen some herbs did not seem such a very grave
offence; so with due advice to keep his hands from picking and
stealing, and a psalm to say for his penance, the priest sent him to
communion.</p>
<p>Then came the second, and there was the same dialogue. Then the
third and the fourth, till all the seven had been up.</p>
<p>At last the priest began to think it was a very odd circumstance
that such a number of full-grown men should all of a sudden have taken
into their heads to go stealing salad herbs; and when the seventh had
had his say he rejoined,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what do you mean by <i>mistuanza</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, any mixture of things,&rsquo; replied the countryman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay; that&rsquo;s not the way we use the word,&rsquo;
responded the priest; &lsquo;so tell me <i>what</i>
&ldquo;things&rdquo; you mean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, some cow, some pig, and some fowl.&rsquo;<a class=

righteous indignation, starting out of the confessional; &lsquo;Come
back! come back! you can&rsquo;t go to communion like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The seven clodhoppers, finding themselves discovered, began to fear
the rigour of justice, and decamped as fast as they could.</p>

galline.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&lsquo;Un po&rsquo; (un poco) a little. The
effect of the story depended a good deal on the tones of voice in which
it was told. The deprecatory tone of the penitent as he says, &lsquo;un
po&rsquo; di bove,&rsquo; &amp;c., and the horror of the priest as he
cries out, &lsquo;Signori della <i>mistuanza</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="footnote cont">This same story in quite another dress was
told me one evening in Aldershot Camp; and as it is a very curious
instance of the migration of myths, I give the home version.</p>
<p class="footnote cont"><a id="xd26e9226" name="xd26e9226"></a>It
would seem that in Aldershot lingo, or in the lingo of a certain
regiment once stationed there, to &lsquo;kill a fox&rsquo; means to get
drunk. Possibly the expression was acquired during the Peninsular war,
as &lsquo;<span lang="es">tomar una zorrilla</span>&rsquo; has an
equivalent meaning in Spanish. The story was this. Once during the
brief holiday of the chaplain of the regiment, a French priest who knew
a little English took his place. At confession the chief fault of
which, according to the story, the men accused themselves was that they
had &lsquo;killed a fox,&rsquo; an expression perfectly well understood
by their own pastor. The good French priest, however, instead of being
shocked at finding how often men got drunk, was highly edified at the
angelic simplicity of these Angles, who showed so much contrition for
having indulged in the innocent pastime&mdash;in France, not even an
offence among sportsmen&mdash;of having killed a fox.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">At last there came one of a more humorous turn
of mind than the rest, and the <i>surnois</i> air with which he
pronounced the expression revealed to the good Frenchman that the words
meant something more than they said.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&lsquo;Vat mean you ven you say, &ldquo;kill
de fox?&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; now inquired the Frenchman of his penitent
with fear and trembling. And the blunt soldier had no sooner expounded
the slang than the bewildered foreigner threw open the front wicket of
the confessional and cried aloud:</p>

foxes! Come back! come back!&rsquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was an old couple who earned a poor living by
working hard all day in the fields.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See how hard we work all day,&rsquo; said the wife;
&lsquo;and it all comes of the foolish curiosity of Adam and Eve. If it
had not been for that we should have been living now in a beautiful
garden, with nothing to do all day long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the husband; &lsquo;if you and I had been
there, instead of Adam and Eve, all the human race had been in Paradise
still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The count, their master, overheard them talking in this way, and he
came to them and said: &lsquo;How would you like it if I took you up
into my palazzo there, to live and gave you servants to wait on you,
and plenty to eat and drink?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that would be delightful indeed! That would be as good as
Paradise itself!&rsquo; answered husband and wife together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you may come up there if you think so. Only remember,
in Paradise there was one tree that was not to be touched; so at my
table there will be one dish not to be touched. You mustn&rsquo;t mind
that,&rsquo; said the count.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, of course not,&rsquo; replied the old peasant;
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s just what I say: when Eve had all the fruits in the
garden, what did she want with just that one that was forbidden? And if
we, who are used to the scantiest victuals, are supplied with enough to
live well, what does it matter to us whether there is an extra dish or
not on the table?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well reasoned,&rsquo; said the count. &lsquo;We quite
understand each other, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfectly,&rsquo; replied both husband and wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You come to live at my palace, and have everything you can
want there, so long as you don&rsquo;t open one dish<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e9280src" href="#xd26e9280" name="xd26e9280src">2</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>which there will be in the middle of the table.
If you open that you go back to your former way of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We quite understand,&rsquo; answered the peasants.</p>
<p>The count went in and called his servant, and told him to give the
peasants an apartment to themselves, with everything they could want,
and a sumptuous dinner, only in the middle of the table was to be an
earthen dish, into which he was to put a little bird alive, so that if
one lifted the cover the bird would fly out. He was to stay in the room
and wait on them, and report to him what happened.</p>
<p>The old people sat down to dinner, and praised everything they saw,
so delightful it all seemed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look! that&rsquo;s the dish we&rsquo;re not to touch,&rsquo;
said the wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; better <i>not</i> look at it,&rsquo; said the
husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pshaw! there&rsquo;s no danger of wanting to open it, when we
have such a lot of dishes to eat our fill out of,&rsquo; returned the
wife.</p>
<p>So they set to, and made such a repast as they had never dreamed of
before. By degrees, however, as the novelty of the thing wore off, they
grew more and more desirous for something newer and newer still. Though
when they at first sat down it had seemed that two dishes would be
ample to satisfy them, they had now had seven or eight and they were
wishing there might be others coming. There is an end to all things
human, and no other came; there only remained the earthen dish in the
middle of the table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We might just lift the lid up a little wee bit,&rsquo; said
the wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; <span class="corr" id="xd26e9307" title=
"Source: dont">don&rsquo;t</span> talk about it,&rsquo; said the
husband.</p>
<p>The wife sat still for five minutes, and then she said: &lsquo;If
one just lifted up one corner of the lid it could scarcely be called
opening it, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better leave it alone altogether, and not think about it at
all,&rsquo; said the husband. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343"
href="#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span></p>
<p>The wife sat still another five minutes, and then she said:
&lsquo;If one peeped in just the least in the world it would not be any
harm, surely; and I <i>should</i> so like to know what there can
possibly be. Now, what <i>can</i> the count have put in that
dish?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t guess in the least,&rsquo; said
the husband; &lsquo;and I must say I can&rsquo;t see what it can
signify to him if we did look at it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; that&rsquo;s what I think. And besides, how would he know
if we peeped? it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt him,&rsquo; said the wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; as you say, one could just take a look,&rsquo; said the
husband.</p>
<p>The wife didn&rsquo;t want more encouragement than that. But when
she lifted one side of the lid the least mite she could see nothing.
She opened it the least mite more, and the bird flew out. The servant
ran and told his master, and the count came down and drove them out,
bidding them never complain of Adam and Eve any more.</p>

"xd26e9350src" href="#xd26e9350" name="xd26e9350src">3</a>, but he
didn&rsquo;t think about anything else, and he soon found that she was
no housewife, was never satisfied unless she was gadding out somewhere,
would not take a word of reproof, and, what was more, she spent all his
money.</p>
<p>Every day there were furious quarrels; it was bad enough while the
money lasted&mdash;and he had brought a good provision with
him&mdash;but when the money came to an end it was much worse; he was
ever reproaching her with extravagance, and she him with stinginess and
deception.</p>
<p>At last he said to her one day, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use making a
piece of work; I&rsquo;m quite tired of this sort of life; I shall go
back to Hell, which is a much quieter place than a house where you are.
But I don&rsquo;t mind doing you a good turn first. I&rsquo;ll go and
possess myself of a certain queen. You dress up like a doctor, and say
you will heal her, and all you will have to do will be to pretend to
use some ointments<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9357src" href=
"#xd26e9357" name="xd26e9357src">4</a> for two or three days, on which
I will go out of her. Then they will be so delighted with you for
healing her that they will give you a lot of money, on which you can
live for the rest of your days, and I will go back to Hell.&rsquo; But
though he said this, it was only to get rid of her. As soon as he had
provided her with the price for casting him out once, he meant to go
and amuse himself on earth in other ways; he had no real intention of
going back to Hell. Then he instructed her in the means by which she
was to find out the queen of whom he was to possess himself, and went
his way.</p>
<p>The wife, by following the direction he gave, soon found him, and,
dressed as a doctor, effected the cure; that is, she made herself known
to him in applying the ointments, and he went away as he had
agreed.</p>
<p>When the king and the court saw what a wonderful <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span>cure
had been effected, they gave the woman a sackfull of scudi, but all the
people went on talking of her success.</p>
<p>The devil meantime had possessed himself of another sovereign, a
king this time, and everybody in the kingdom was very desirous to have
him cured, and went inquiring everywhere for a remedy. Thus they heard
of the fame of the last cure by the devil&rsquo;s wife. Then they
immediately sent for her and insisted that she should cure this king
too. But she, not sure whether he would go out a second time at her
bidding, refused as long as she could; but they took her, and said,
&lsquo;Unless you cure him we shall kill you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you must shut me up alone with
this king, and I will try what I can do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So she was shut up alone with him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! you here again!&rsquo; said the devil as soon as he
perceived her. &lsquo;No; that won&rsquo;t do this time. I am very
comfortable inside this old king, and I mean to stay here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But they threaten to kill me if I don&rsquo;t make you go; so
what am I to do?&rsquo; answered the wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help that,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;you must
get out of the scrape the best way you can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this she got in a passion, and, as she used to do in the days
when they were living together, rated him so fiercely that at last he
was fain to go to escape her scolding.</p>
<p>Once more she received a high price for the cure, and her fame got
the more bruited abroad.</p>
<p>But the devil went into another queen, and possessed himself of her.
The fame of the two cures had spread so far that the wife was soon
called in to try her powers again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I really can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; she pleaded; but the people
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What you did for the other two you can do for this one; and,
if you don&rsquo;t, we will cut off your head.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span></p>
<p>To save her head, therefore, she said, &lsquo;Then you must shut me
up in a room alone with the queen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So she was shut up in the room with her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! you here again!&rsquo; exclaimed the devil as soon as
he perceived her. &lsquo;No; I positively won&rsquo;t go this time; I
couldn&rsquo;t be better off than inside this old queen, and till you
came I was perfectly happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They threaten to take my head if I don&rsquo;t make you go;
so what am I to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then let them take your head, and let that be an end of
it,&rsquo; replied the devil testily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a pretty husband, indeed, to say such a speech to a
wife!&rsquo; answered she in a high-pitched voice, which he knew was
the foretaste of one of those terrible storms he could never
resist.</p>
<p><i>Basta!</i> she stormed so loud that she sickened him of her for
good and all, and this time, to escape her, instead of possessing
himself of any more kings and queens, he went straight off to Hell, and
never came forth any more for fear of meeting her.</p>

<h2 class="main"><i>THE ROOT.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a rich count who married an extravagant
wife. As he had plenty of money he let her spend whatever she liked.
But he had no idea what a woman could spend, and very much surprised
was he when he found that dressmakers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>and milliners, and
hairdressers, and shoemakers had made such a hole in his fortune that
there was very little left. He saw it was high time to look after it,
and he ventured to tender some words of remonstrance; but the moment he
began to speak about it she went into hysterics. There was such a
dreadful scene that he feared to approach the subject again, but the
matter became so serious that at last he was obliged to do so. The
least allusion, however, brought on another fit of hysterics.</p>
<p>What was he to do? To go on at this extravagant rate was impossible;
equally impossible was it to endure the terrible scenes which ensued
when he attempted to make her more careful.</p>
<p>At last he went to a doctor whom he knew, and asked him if he could
give him any remedy for hysterics, telling him the whole story of what
he wanted it for.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes!&rsquo; replied the doctor; &lsquo;I have an
infallible cure. It is a certain root which must be applied very
sharply to the back of the neck. If it doesn&rsquo;t succeed with the
first half-dozen applications, you must go on till it does. It never
fails in the end.&rsquo; So saying, he gave him a stout root, as thick
as a walking stick, with a knobbed end.</p>
<p>Strong with the promised remedy, the husband went home, and sent
word to all the dressmakers, milliners, hairdressers, and shoemakers
that he would pay for nothing more except what he ordered himself.
Indeed he met the shoemaker on the step of the door, who had just come
to take the measure for a pair of velvet slippers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bring them,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;she has seven
or eight pairs already, and that is quite enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he went up to his wife, and told her what he had done. Such a
scene of hysterics as he had never imagined before awaited him now, but
he, full of confidence in his remedy, took no notice further than to go
up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>to her and apply the root very smartly to the
back of her neck as he had been directed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But to me it seems that was all one with beating her with a
stick,&rsquo; exclaimed another old woman who was sitting in the room
knitting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course! That&rsquo;s just the fun of it!&rsquo; replied
the narrator. &lsquo;And the beauty of it was that he was so simple
that he thought it was some virtue in the root that was to effect the
cure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hysterics stopped, and he ran off to the doctor to thank him for
the capital remedy. The wife ran off, too, and went to her friends
crying with terrible complaints that her husband would not allow her a
single thing to put on, and, moreover, had even been beating her.</p>
<p>When the count got back from the doctor, he found the father and
half the family there ready to abuse him for making his wife go about
with nothing on, and beating her into the bargain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is all a mistake,&rsquo; said the count. &lsquo;I will
allow her everything that is right, only I will order myself what I pay
for; and, as to beating her, I only applied this root which I got from
the doctor to cure hysterics; nothing more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s a case of hysterics is it!&rsquo; said the
father; &lsquo;then it is all quite right,&rsquo; and he and the rest
went away; and the count and his wife got on very well after that, and
he never had to make use of the doctor&rsquo;s root again.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They say there was a queen who had such a bad temper
that she made everybody about her miserable. Whatever her husband might
do to please her, she was always discontented, and as for her maids she
was always slapping their faces. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349"
href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span></p>
<p>There was a fairy who saw all this, and she said to herself,
&lsquo;This must not be allowed to go on;&rsquo; so she went and called
another fairy, and said, &lsquo;What shall we do to teach this naughty
queen to behave herself?&rsquo; and they could not imagine what to do
with her; so they agreed to think it over, and meet again another
day.</p>
<p>When they met again, the first fairy said to the other, &lsquo;Well,
have you found any plan for correcting this naughty queen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied the second fairy; &lsquo;I have found an
excellent plan. I have been up and all over the whole town, and in a
little dirty back lane<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9464src" href=
"#xd26e9464" name="xd26e9464src">2</a> I have found a tripe-seller as
like to this queen as two peas.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9467src" href="#xd26e9467" name="xd26e9467src">3</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Excellent!&rsquo; exclaimed the first fairy. &lsquo;I see
what you mean to do. One of us will take some of the queen&rsquo;s
clothes and dress up the tripe-seller, and the other will take some of
the tripe-seller&rsquo;s clothes and dress up the queen in them, and
then we will exchange them till the queen learns better
manners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the plan,&rsquo; replied the second fairy.
&lsquo;You have said it exactly. When shall we begin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This very night,&rsquo; said the first fairy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Agreed!&rsquo; said the second fairy; and that very night,
while everyone else was gone quietly to bed they went, one into the
palace and fetched some of the queen&rsquo;s clothes, and, bringing
them to the tripe-seller&rsquo;s room, placed them by the side of her
bed; and the other went to the tripe-seller&rsquo;s room and fetched
her clothes, and took them and put them by the side of the
queen&rsquo;s bed. They also woke them very early, and when each got up
she put on the things that were by the side of the bed, thinking they
were the things she had left there the night before. Thus the queen was
dressed like a tripe-seller, and the tripe-seller like a queen.</p>
<p>Then one fairy took the queen, dressed like a tripe-seller, and put
her down in the tripe-seller&rsquo;s shop, and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>other fairy took the tripe-seller, dressed like
a queen, and placed her in the palace, and both of them did their work
so swiftly that neither the queen nor the tripe-seller perceived the
flight at all.</p>
<p>The queen was very much astonished at finding herself in a
tripe-shop, and began staring about, wondering how she got there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here! Don&rsquo;t stand gaping about like that!&rsquo; cried
the tripe-man,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9490src" href="#xd26e9490"
name="xd26e9490src">4</a> who was a very hot-tempered fellow;
&lsquo;Why, you haven&rsquo;t boiled the coffee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Boiled the coffee!&rsquo; repeated the queen, hardly
apprehending what he meant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; you haven&rsquo;t boiled the coffee!&rsquo; said the
tripe-man. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t repeat my words, but do your work!&rsquo;
and he took her by the shoulders, put the coffee-pot in her hand, and
stood over her looking so fierce that she was frightened into doing
what she had never done or seen done in all her life before.</p>
<p>Presently the coffee began to boil over.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There! Don&rsquo;t waste all the coffee like that!&rsquo;
cried the tripe-man, and he got up and gave her a slap, which made the
tears come in her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t blubber!&rsquo; said the tripe-man; &lsquo;but
bring the coffee here and pour it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The queen did as she was told; but when she began to drink it,
though she had made it herself, it was so nasty she didn&rsquo;t know
how to drink it. It was very different stuff from what she got at the
palace; but the tripe-man had his eye on her, and she didn&rsquo;t dare
not to drink it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A halfp&rsquo;th of cat&rsquo;s-meat!&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9507src" href="#xd26e9507" name="xd26e9507src">5</a>
sang out a small boy in the shop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go and serve the customer?&rsquo; said
the tripe-man, knocking the cup out of the queen&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Fearing another slap, she rose hastily to give the boy what he
wanted, but not knowing one thing in the shop <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span>from
another, she gave him a large piece of the best tripe fit for a
prince.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, what fine tripe to-day!&rsquo; cried the small boy, and
ran away as fast as he could.</p>
<p>It was in vain the tripe-man halloed after him, he was in too great
a hurry to secure his prize to think of returning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look what you&rsquo;ve done!&rsquo; cried the tripe-man,
giving the queen another slap; &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve given that boy for a
penny a bunch of tripe worth a shilling.&rsquo; Luckily, other
customers came in and diverted the man&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Presently all the tripe hanging up had been sold, and more customers
kept coming in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What has come to you, to-day!&rsquo; roared the tripe-man, as
the queen stood not knowing what to do with herself. &lsquo;Do you mean
to say you haven&rsquo;t washed that other lot of tripe!&rsquo; and
this time he gave her a kick.</p>
<p>To escape his fury, the queen turned to do her best with washing the
other tripe, but she did it so awkwardly that she got a volley of abuse
and blows too.</p>
<p>Then came dinner-time, and nothing prepared, or even bought to
prepare, for dinner. Another stormy scene ensued at the discovery, and
the tripe-man went to dine at the inn, leaving her to go without any
dinner at all, in punishment for having neglected to prepare it.</p>
<p>While he was gone she helped all the customers to the wrong things,
and, when he came home, got another scolding and more blows for her
stupidity. And all through the afternoon it was the same story.</p>
<p>But the tripe-seller, when she found herself all in a palace, with
half-a-dozen maids waiting to attend her, was equally bewildered. When
they kept asking her if there was nothing she pleased to want, she kept
answering, &lsquo;No thank you,&rsquo; in such a gentle tone, the maids
began to think that a reign of peace had come to them at last.</p>
<p>By-and-by, when the ladies came, instead of saying, as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span>the
queen had been wont, &lsquo;What an ugly dress you have got; go and
take it off!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;How nice you look; how tasteful
your dress is!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the king came in, bringing her a rare nosegay. Instead of
throwing it on one side to vex him, as the queen had been wont, she
showed so much delight, and expressed her thanks so many times, that he
was quite overcome.</p>
<p>The change that had come over the queen soon became the talk of the
whole palace, and everyone congratulated himself on an improvement
which made them all happy. The king was no less pleased than all the
rest, and for the first time for many years he said he would drive out
with the queen; for on account of her bad temper he had long given up
driving with her. So the carriage came round with four prancing horses,
and an escort of cavalry to ride before and behind it. The tripe-seller
hardly could believe she was to drive in this splendid carriage, but
the king handed her in before she knew where she was. Then, as he was
so pleased with her gentle and grateful ways, he further asked her to
say which way she would like to drive.</p>
<p>The tripe-seller, partly because she was too much frightened to
think of any other place, and partly because she thought it would be
nice to drive in state through her own neighbourhood, named the broader
street out of which turned the lane in which she lived, for the royal
carriage could hardly have turned down the lane itself. The king
repeated the order, and away drove the royal <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e9546" title="Source: cort&eacute;ge">cort&egrave;ge</span>.</p>
<p>The circumstance of the king and queen driving out together was
sufficient to excite the attention of the whole population, and
wherever they passed the people crowded into the streets; thus a volley
of shouts and comments ran before the carriage towards the lane of the
tripe-man. The tripe-man was at the moment engaged in administering a
severe chastisement to the queen for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>her latest mistake,
and the roar of the people&rsquo;s voices afforded a happy pretext for
breaking away from him.</p>
<p>She ran with the rest to the opening of the lane just as the royal
carriage was passing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My husband! my husband!&rsquo; she screamed as the king drove
by, and plaintive as was her voice, and different from her usual
imperious tone, he heard it and turned his head towards her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My husband! my royal husband!&rsquo; pleaded the humbled
queen.</p>
<p>The king, in amazement, stopped the carriage and gazed from the
queen in the gutter to the tripe-seller in royal array by his side,
unable to solve the problem.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is certainly my wife!&rsquo; he said at last, as he
extended his hand to the queen. &lsquo;Who then can you be?&rsquo; he
added, addressing the tripe-seller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell the truth,&rsquo; replied the good tripe-seller.
&lsquo;I am no queen; I am the poor wife of the tripe-seller down the
lane there; but how I came into the palace is more than I can
say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how come you here?&rsquo; said the king, addressing the
real queen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That, neither can I tell; I thought you had sent me hither to
punish me for my bad temper; but if you will only take me back I will
never be bad-tempered again; only take me away from this dreadful
tripe-man, who has been beating me all day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the king made answer: &lsquo;Of course you must come back with
me, for you are my wife. But,&rsquo; he said to the tripe-seller;
&lsquo;what shall I do with you? After you have been living in luxury
in the palace, you will feel it hard to go back to sell
tripe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s true I have not many luxuries at home,&rsquo;
answered the tripe-seller; &lsquo;but yet I had rather be with my
husband than in any palace in the world;&rsquo; and she descended from
the carriage, while the queen got in. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; said the king. &lsquo;This day&rsquo;s
transformation, howsoever it was brought about, has been a good day,
and you have been so well behaved, and so truth-spoken, I don&rsquo;t
like your going back to be beaten by the tripe-man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, never mind that,&rsquo; said the good wife; &lsquo;he
never beats me unless I do something very stupid. And, after all,
he&rsquo;s my husband, and that&rsquo;s enough for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re satisfied, I won&rsquo;t interfere any
further,&rsquo; said the king; &lsquo;except to give you some mark of
my royal favour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he bestowed on the tripe-man and his wife a beautiful villa, with
a nice casino outside the gates, on condition that he never beat her
any more.</p>
<p>The tripe-man was so pleased with the gifts which had come to him
through his wife&rsquo;s good conduct, that he kept his word, and was
always thereafter very kind to her. And the queen was so frightened at
the thought that she might find herself suddenly transformed into a
tripe-seller again, that she kept a strict guard over her temper, and
became the delight of her husband and the whole court.</p>

<p class="first">They say there was a queen who was so bad-tempered
that no one who could help it would come near her. All the servants ran
away when she came out of her apartment, for fear she should scold and
maltreat them; all the people ran away when she drove out, for fear she
should vex them with some tyrannical order. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span></p>
<p>As she was rich and beautiful, and ruled over vast dominions, many
princes&mdash;who in their distant kingdoms had heard nothing of her
failing&mdash;came to sue for her hand, but she sent them all away and
would have nothing to say to any of them. She used to say she did not
want to have anyone to be her master; she had rather live and govern by
herself, and have everything her own way.</p>
<p>As time went on, however, the council of state grew dissatisfied
with this resolution. They insisted that she must marry, that there
might be a family of princes to carry on the succession to the throne
without dispute. When the queen found that she could not help it she
agreed she would marry; but she was determined she would not marry any
of the princes who had come to court her, because, as they were equal
to herself in birth and state, they would want to rule over her and
expect obedience from her. She declared she would marry no one but a
certain duke, who, as she had observed in the council and in the state
banquets and balls, was always very quiet and hardly ever spoke at all.
She thought he would make a nice quiet manageable sort of husband, and
she would have him if she must have one at all.</p>
<p>The duke was as silent as usual when he was spoken to about it; but
as he made no objection he was reckoned to have consented, and the
marriage was duly solemnised.</p>
<p>As soon as the marriage was over the queen went on making her
arrangements and ordering matters in the palace just as if nothing had
happened, and she were still her own mistress. In particular she issued
invitations for the grandest ball she had ever given, asking to it all
the ministers and their families, and all the nobility of the
kingdom.</p>
<p>The husband said nothing to all this, only a few hours before the
time appointed for the banquet he called to the queen, saying:
&lsquo;Put on your travelling dress, and make haste; the carriage will
be round directly.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href=
"#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to put on my travelling dress,&rsquo;
answered the queen scornfully; &lsquo;I am just seeing about my evening
dress for the banquet this evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you are not ready in your travelling dress in five
minutes, when the carriage comes round, it will be worse for you. Mind
I have warned you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he looked so determined that she quailed before him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can we be going into the country, when I have invited
half the kingdom to a banquet?&rsquo; exclaimed the queen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I</i> have invited no one,&rsquo; answered the husband
quietly. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stand hesitating when I tell you to do a
thing; go and get ready directly! we are going into the country!&rsquo;
he added in his most positive voice, and, though she shed many secret
tears over the loss of the banquet, she ventured to oppose nothing more
to his orders, but went up and dressed, and when the carriage came
round she was nearly ready. In about five minutes she came down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t say anything this time about your keeping me
waiting,&rsquo; he said when she appeared; &lsquo;but mind it does not
happen again, or you will be sorry for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The queen had a favourite little dog, which she fondled and talked
to all the way, to show she was offended with her husband and
independent of his conversation.</p>
<p>Watching an opportunity when she was silent, the husband said to the
little dog, &lsquo;Jump on to my lap.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not going to obey you,&rsquo; said the queen
contemptuously; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s <i>my</i> dog!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I keep no one about me who does not obey me,&rsquo; said her
husband quietly; and he took out his pistol and shot the dog through
the head.</p>
<p>The queen began to understand that the husband she had chosen was
not a person to be trifled with, nor did she venture even to utter a
complaint.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the villa, as the queen was going <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span>to
her apartment to undress, her husband called her to him into his room
and bade her pull off his boots.</p>
<p>The queen&rsquo;s first impulse was to utter a haughty refusal; but
by this time she had learnt that, as she would certainly have to give
in to him in the end, it was better to do his bidding with a good grace
at the first. So she said nothing, but knelt down and pulled off his
boots.</p>
<p>When she had done this he got up and said: &lsquo;Now sit down in
this armchair and I will take off your shoes; for my way is that one
should help the other. If you behave to me as <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e9643" title="Not in source">a</span> wife should, you need never
fear but that I shall behave to you as a husband should.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By the time their visit to the country was at an end, and when they
returned to the capital, everybody found their naughty queen had become
the most angelic being imaginable.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a man and his wife who had a young daughter
to marry; and there was a man who was seeking a wife. So the man who
was seeking a wife came to the man who had a daughter to marry, and
said, &lsquo;Give me your daughter for a wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the man who had a daughter to
marry;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9666src" href="#xd26e9666" name=
"xd26e9666src">2</a> &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll do very well; you&rsquo;re
just about the sort of son-in-law I want.&rsquo; And then he added:
&lsquo;If our daughter is to be betrothed to-day, it is the occasion
for a feast.&rsquo; So to the wife he said, &lsquo;Prepare the
table;&rsquo; and to the daughter he said, &lsquo;Draw the
wine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The daughter went down into the cellar to draw the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span>wine. But as she drew the wine she began to cry,
saying: &lsquo;If I am to be married I shall have a child, and the
child will be a son, and the son will be a priest, and the priest will
be a bishop, and the bishop will be a cardinal, and the cardinal will
be a pope.&rsquo; And she cried and cried, and the wine was running all
the time, so that the bottle<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9763src" href=
"#xd26e9763" name="xd26e9763src">3</a> she was filling ran over, and
went on running over.</p>
<p>Then said the father and mother: &lsquo;What can the girl be doing
down in the cellar so long?&rsquo; But the mother said: &lsquo;I must
go and see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the mother went down to see why she was so long, but the moment
she came into the cellar she, too, began to cry; so that the wine still
went on running over.</p>
<p>Then the father said: &lsquo;What can the girl and her mother both
be doing so long down in the cellar? I must go and see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the father went down into the cellar; but the moment he got into
the cellar he, too, began to cry, and could do nothing for crying; so
the wine still went on running over.</p>
<p>Then he who had come to seek a wife said: &lsquo;What can these
people all be doing so long down in the cellar?&rsquo; So he, too, went
down to see, and found them all crying in the cellar and the wine
running over. Only when the wine was all run out they left off crying
and came upstairs again.</p>
<p>Then the betrothal and the marriage were happily celebrated.</p>
<p>One day after they were married the husband went into the market to
buy meat, and he bought a large provision because he had invited a
friend to dinner. When the wife saw him buy such a quantity of meat she
began to cry, saying: &lsquo;What can we do with such a lot of
meat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, never mind, don&rsquo;t make a misery of it,&rsquo; said
the husband; &lsquo;put it behind you.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9786src" href="#xd26e9786" name="xd26e9786src">4</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name="pb359">359</a>]</span></p>
<p>The simple wife took the meat and went home, saying to her
parents,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9795src" href="#xd26e9795" name=
"xd26e9795src">5</a> and crying the while: &lsquo;My husband says I am
to put all this meat behind me! Do tell me what <i>can</i> I
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t put the whole lot of it behind you,
that&rsquo;s certain,&rsquo; replied the equally simple mother;
&lsquo;but we can manage it between us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then she took the meat and put all the hard, bony part on one chair,
where she made the father sit down on it; all the fat, skinny part she
put on another chair, and made the wife sit down on it; and the fleshy,
meaty part she put on another chair, and sat down on that herself.</p>
<p>Presently the husband came with his friend, ready for dinner,
knocking at the door. None of the three dared to move, however, that
they might not cease to be fulfilling his injunctions. Then he looked
through the keyhole, and, seeing them all sitting down without moving
when he knocked, he thought they must all be dead; so he ran and
fetched a locksmith, who opened the door for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What on earth are you all doing there,&rsquo; exclaimed the
hungry husband, &lsquo;instead of getting dinner ready?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You told me to put the meat behind me, and I have done
so,&rsquo; answered the simple wife.</p>
<p>Then he saw they were sitting on the meat. Out of all patience with
such idiocy, he exclaimed: &lsquo;This is the last you&rsquo;ll ever
see of me. At least I promise you not to come back till I have met
three other people as idiotic as you, and that&rsquo;s hardly likely to
occur.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that he took his friend to a tavern to dine, and then put on a
pilgrim&rsquo;s dress and went wandering over the country.</p>
<p>In the first city he came to there was great public rejoicing going
on. The princess had just been married, and the court was keeping high
festival. As he came up to the palace the bride and bridegroom were
just come back from church. The bride wore one of those very high
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>round headdresses that they used to wear in
olden time, with a long veil hanging from it. It was so very high that
she could not by any means get in at the door, and there she stuck, not
knowing what to do. Then she began to cry, saying: &lsquo;What shall I
do? what shall I do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I tell you what to do?&rsquo; said the pilgrim-husband,
drawing near.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, pray do, if you can; I will give you a hundred scudi if
you will only show me how to get in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he went and made her go a few steps backward, and then bow her
head very low, and so she could pass under the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, I have found one woman as simple as my people at
home,&rsquo; said the pilgrim-husband, as he sat down to the banquet at
the special invitation of the princess, in reward for his services.
Afterwards she counted out a hundred scudi to him, and he went
further.</p>
<p>Further along the road he came to a farm, with barns and cattle and
plenty of stock about, and a large well at which a woman was drawing
water. Instead of dipping in the pail, she had got the well-rope
knotted into a huge knot, which she kept dipping into the water and
squeezing out into the pail, and she kept crying as she did so:
&lsquo;Oh, how long shall I be filling the pail! The pail will never be
full!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I show you how to fill it?&rsquo; asked the
pilgrim-husband, drawing near.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, do show me if you can. I will give you a hundred
scudi if you will only show me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he took all the knots out of the rope and let down the pail by
it, and filled it in a minute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a second woman as stupid as my people at
home,&rsquo; said the pilgrim-husband, as the farmer&rsquo;s wife asked
him in to dinner in reward for his great services; &lsquo;if I go on at
this rate I shall have to return to her at last, in spite of my
protestations.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href=
"#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span></p>
<p>After that the farmer&rsquo;s wife counted out the hundred scudi of
the promised reward, and he went on further, having first packed six
eggs into his hollow staff as provision for the journey.</p>
<p>Towards nightfall he arrived at a lone cottage. Here he knocked and
asked a bed for his night&rsquo;s lodging.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t give you that,&rsquo; said a voice from the
inside; &lsquo;for I am a lone widow. I can&rsquo;t take a man in to
sleep here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I am a pilgrim,&rsquo; replied he; &lsquo;let me in at
least to cook a bit of supper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>That</i> I don&rsquo;t mind doing,&rsquo; said the good
wife, and she opened the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks, good friend!&rsquo; said the pilgrim-husband as he
sat down by the stove; &lsquo;now add to your charity a couple of eggs
in a pan.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9855src" href="#xd26e9855"
name="xd26e9855src">6</a></p>
<p>So she gave him a pan and two eggs, and a bit of butter to cook them
in; but he took the six eggs out of his staff and broke them into the
pan, too.</p>
<p>Presently, when the good wife turned her head his way again, and saw
eight eggs swimming in the pan instead of two, she said:
&lsquo;Lack-a-day! you must surely be some strange being from the other
world. Do you know so-and-so there&rsquo; (naming her dead
husband)?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; said the pilgrim-husband, enjoying the joke;
&lsquo;I know him very well; he lives just next to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only to think of that!&rsquo; replied the poor woman.
&lsquo;And do tell me, how do you get on in the other world? What sort
of a life is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, not so very bad; it depends what sort of a place you get.
The part where we are is not very bad, except that we get very little
to eat. Your husband, for instance, is nearly starved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, really!&rsquo; cried the good wife, clasping her hands;
&lsquo;only fancy! my good husband starving out there; so fond as he
was of a good dinner, too!&rsquo; Then she added, coaxingly: &lsquo;As
you know him so well, perhaps you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362"
href="#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span>wouldn&rsquo;t mind doing him
the charity of taking him a little somewhat to give him a treat. There
are such lots of things I could easily send him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, dear no, not at all; I&rsquo;ll do it with great
pleasure,&rsquo; answered he; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m not going back till
to-morrow; and if I don&rsquo;t sleep here I must go on further, and
then I shan&rsquo;t come by this way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; replied the widow. &lsquo;Ah, well,
I mustn&rsquo;t mind what the folks say, for such an opportunity as
this may never occur again. You must sleep in my bed, and I must sleep
on the hearth; and in the morning I&rsquo;ll load a donkey with
provisions for my poor dear husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; replied the pilgrim; &lsquo;you shan&rsquo;t
be disturbed in your bed; only let me sleep on the hearth, that will do
for me; and as I&rsquo;m an early riser I can be gone before
anyone&rsquo;s astir, so folks won&rsquo;t have anything to
say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So it was done, and an hour before sunrise the woman was up loading
the donkey with the best of her stores. There were ham, and maccaroni,
and flour, and cheese, and wine. All this she committed to the pilgrim,
saying: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll send the donkey back, won&rsquo;t
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I would send him back; he&rsquo;d be no use to us
out there: but I shan&rsquo;t get out again myself for another hundred
years or so, and I fear he won&rsquo;t find his way back alone, for
it&rsquo;s no easy way to find.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure not; I ought to have thought of that,&rsquo;
replied the widow. &lsquo;Ah, well, so as my poor husband gets a good
meal never mind the donkey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the pretended pilgrim from the other world went his way. He
hadn&rsquo;t gone a hundred yards before the widow called him back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, she&rsquo;s beginning to think better of it!&rsquo; said
he to himself; and he continued his way, pretending not to hear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good pilgrim!&rsquo; shouted the widow; &lsquo;I forgot one
thing. Would any money be of use to my poor dear husband?&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=
"pb363">363</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear yes, all the use in the world,&rsquo; replied the
pilgrim; &lsquo;you can always get anything for money
everywhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, do come back then, and I&rsquo;ll trouble you with a
hundred scudi for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The pretended pilgrim came back willingly for the hundred scudi, and
the widow counted them out to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no help for it,&rsquo; soliloquised he as he went
his way; &lsquo;I must go back to those at home. I have actually found
three women each more stupid than they.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he went home to live, and complained no more of the simplicity of
his wife.</p>
<p class="editorial">[We have the German of this story in &lsquo;Die

story entitled &lsquo;<span lang="pt">Pedro da Malas
Artes</span>&rsquo; (Tricky Peter), which embodies these incidents, but
opens with a different purport. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365"

<p class="editorial"><span class="sc">Tricky Peter</span> was a knowing
blade; so he went out on his travels to set all the world straight; and
he found plenty to do.</p>
<p class="editorial">In the very first town he came to there was a
great commotion. A bride had come to church to be married, and there
she stuck at the church door, mounted on her mule, while the people
deliberated whether they should facilitate her ingress by cutting off
some of her head or some of the mule&rsquo;s legs.</p>
<p class="editorial">&lsquo;Let her alight and walk in,&rsquo; said
Tricky Peter; &lsquo;and the door will be high enough.&rsquo; And all
the people applauded his wisdom.</p>
<p class="editorial">At the next town he found the people all full of
discontent, because one of them had to sit up by turns to tell the
others when the sun rose.</p>
<p class="editorial">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a bird to perform that
office,&rsquo; said Tricky Peter; and he went home and fetched a cock,
and then they could all rest comfortably.</p>
<p class="editorial">After this the story has no more silly people to
deal with; but Peter fools a giant, and overcomes his strength with
craft. He does not seem, either, to get paid for his services, as do
the heroes of &lsquo;La Sposa Cese,&rsquo; and all the others.</p>
<p class="editorial">I have also another Roman story (too long to print
here) of a man who sets out with a different purpose again, who meets
with three sets of people afflicted with similar follies, and who also
makes a good deal of money by his counsel; together with various
stories in which men go to fetch their wives back from the
devil&rsquo;s kingdom, get three commissions of a similar nature by the
way, for executing which they get richly paid on their return.</p>
<p class="editorial">There is a story in the 5th Tantra given as
&lsquo;<span lang="fr">Le Brahme aux vains projets</span>&rsquo; in
Abb&eacute; Dubois&rsquo; translation of the
&lsquo;Pantcha-Tantra,&rsquo; which has an analogous opening to that of
&lsquo;<span lang="it">La Sposa Cece</span>.&rsquo; There is another

which of them can claim to be the greatest idiot&mdash;a strife only
second in folly to that of the &lsquo;Three Indolent Boys&rsquo; in

with consummate folly that the decision given is that there is not a

<p class="first">Another version of this story was told me, or rather
an entirely different story embodying the same purport, which, though
full of fun, turned on the double meanings of common words of household
use too homely for the most part, and some too coarse to please the
English reader. The husband, among other things, tells his wife to
prepare dinner for a friend and to mind she has &lsquo;brocoli
strascinati&rsquo; and &lsquo;uovi spersi,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9973src" href="#xd26e9973" name="xd26e9973src">8</a> as they are
his favourite dishes. &lsquo;Strascinare&rsquo; is to drag anything
along, but is technically used to express brocoli chopped up and fried,
the commonest Roman dish. &lsquo;Spergere&rsquo; is to scatter, but the
word is used among common people to express eggs poached in broth, a
favourite delicacy; (eggs poached as in England are called &lsquo;uova
in bianco&rsquo;). The wife, taking the words literally, drags the
brocoli all over the house and all over the yard, till it is so nasty
it cannot be eaten, instead of frying it, and scatters the eggs all
about the place instead of poaching them, and so on through a number of
other absurdities difficult to explain in detail. In the end the
husband falls ill, partly from her bad cooking and partly from
annoyance; a doctor is called in, who tells her (among other directions
which she similarly misunderstands), that he must have nothing but
&lsquo;brodo,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9976src" href=
"#xd26e9976" name="xd26e9976src">9</a> but she is to make it
&lsquo;alto, alto.&rsquo; &lsquo;Alto&rsquo; is literally
&lsquo;high,&rsquo; but he uses it for &lsquo;good,&rsquo;
&lsquo;strong;&rsquo; she, however, understands him to mean her to make
it in a high place, and goes up on the roof to make it. When the
husband asks for it she says she cannot get it for him then as it is up
on the roof.</p>
<p>Ultimately the husband dies of vexation.</p>
<p>There is a very familiar German story which everyone who has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>any acquaintance with the people must have met,
of a lady who complains to her servant that the tea has not
&lsquo;drawn,&rsquo; and the simple girl answers, &lsquo;It is not my
fault, I have <i>drawn</i> it all about the place enough I&rsquo;m
sure&rsquo; (<span lang="de">Ich hab&rsquo; es genug

&lsquo;Cece&rsquo; among the common people seems to mean pretty nearly
the same as &lsquo;tonto,&rsquo; &lsquo;silly,&rsquo;
&lsquo;idiotic;&rsquo; in this place more exactly &lsquo;simple&rsquo;

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9666" href="#xd26e9666src" name="xd26e9666">2</a></span> It is a
characteristic of the Roman people that as a rule they never call
people by their names; the &lsquo;casato&rsquo; or married name, and
the &lsquo;cognome&rsquo; or family name, are used indifferently when
such a name is called in request at all, by married people. If they
must give a name to a stranger it is always the Christian name that
comes first to their lips; among themselves, however, it is seldom the
genuine name that is used. They have some &lsquo;sopranome&rsquo; or
nick-name for everybody, or at least a shortening of the Christian
name, as &lsquo;Checca&rsquo; and &lsquo;Checco&rsquo; for Francesca
and Francesco; &lsquo;Pippo&rsquo; for Filippo; &lsquo;Pepe&rsquo; for
Giuseppe; &lsquo;Cola&rsquo; for Niccola; &lsquo;Maso&rsquo; for
Tomaso; &lsquo;Teta&rsquo; for Teresa; &lsquo;Lalla&rsquo; for
Adelaide; &lsquo;Lina&rsquo; for Carolina; &lsquo;Tuta&rsquo; for
Geltrude; the abbreviations for Giovanni are innumerable.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">But what they most love to designate people by
is a description of their persons. When you come home from your walk,
your servant does not tell you Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so have called, but
it will be &lsquo;Quel signore vecchio ingobbato&rsquo; (that old
hump-backed kind of gentleman), if he be the least grey and
high-shouldered, however young he may be; or &lsquo;<span lang=
"it">Quel bel giovane alto</span>&rsquo; (that tall, handsome, young
gentleman), whatever his age, if he be only <i lang="fr">bien
conserv&eacute;</i>. Then &lsquo;<span lang="it">Quella signora alta,
secca, che veste di lutto</span>&rsquo; (that tall thin lady dressed in
mourning). &lsquo;<span lang="it">Quella signora bella bionda,
giovane</span>&rsquo; (that lady, pretty, fair, young). Or
&lsquo;<span lang="it">Quello che porta il brillante</span>&rsquo; (he
who wears a brilliant), because the same friend happened to have a
diamond stud in his cravat one day; or &lsquo;<span lang="it">Quella
contessa che veste di cilestro</span>,&rsquo; because the lady happened
once to wear a blue dress, and so on, with all manner of signs and
tokens which it may take you half-an-hour to recognise a person by, if
you ever make it out at all. Or, if there is no distinctive mark of the
kind to seize upon, it will be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364"

Palazzo</span>,&rsquo; or &lsquo;<span lang="it">Via</span>,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<span lang="it">Piazza</span>&rsquo; So-and-so. And this not
from the difficulty of catching a foreign name, because it is still
more in vogue when designating their own people; if you are asking for
the address of a servant, a tailor, a dressmaker, &amp;c., it is in
vain you try to make them out by the name, you must do your best to
describe them, and then they will break out with an exclamation hitting
it off for themselves: &lsquo;<span lang="it">Ah! si, quel
scimunito</span>&rsquo; (that silly-looking fellow); &lsquo;<span lang=

&lsquo;uova,&rsquo; but it is very common to make the plural in

<p class="first">There was once a couple well-to-do in the world, who
had one only daughter.</p>
<p>The son of a neighbour came to ask her in marriage, and as the
father thought he would do, the father asked him to dinner, and sent
the daughter down into the cellar to draw the wine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I am married,&rsquo; said the girl to herself, and began
to cry as she drew the wine, &lsquo;I shall have a child, and the child
will be a boy, and the boy will be called Petrillo, and by-and-by he
will die, and I shall be left to lament him, and to cry all day long
&ldquo;Petrillo! Petrillo! where are you!&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; and she
went on crying, and the wine went on running over.</p>
<p>Then the mother went down to see what kept her so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>long, and she repeated the story all over to
her, and the mother answered, &lsquo;Right you are, my girl!&rsquo; and
she, too, began to cry, and the wine was all the time running over.</p>
<p>Then the father went down, and they repeated the story to him, and
he, too, said, &lsquo;Right you are!&rsquo; and he, too, began to cry,
and the wine all the time went on running all over the floor.</p>
<p>Then the young man also goes down to see what is the matter, and
stops the wine running, and makes them all come up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not marry the girl
till I have wandered over the world and found other three as simple as
you.&rsquo; He dines with them, and sets out on his search.</p>
<p>The first night he goes to bed in an inn, and in the morning he
hears in the room next him such lamenting and complaining that he goes
in to see what is the matter. A man is sitting by the side of the bed
lamenting because he cannot get his stockings on.</p>
<p>The young man says, &lsquo;Take hold of one side this way, and the
other side that way, and pull them up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, to be sure!&rsquo; cries the man, and gives him a hundred
scudi for the benefit he has done him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s one of my three simpletons, at all
events,&rsquo; says the young man, and journeys on.</p>
<p>The next day, at the inn where he spends the night, he hears a noise
<i>bru, bru</i>! goes in to see, and finds a man fruitlessly trying to
put walnuts into a sack by sticking a fork into them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll never do it that way,&rsquo; says the young man;
and he shows him how to scoop them up with both his hands and so pour
them in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, to be sure!&rsquo; answers the man, and gives him a
hundred scudi for the favour he has done him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is my second simpleton,&rsquo; says the young man, and
goes further. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span></p>
<p>The third day&mdash;&mdash;Ah! I can&rsquo;t remember what he meets
the third day; but it is something equally stupid, and he gets another
hundred scudi, and goes back and marries the girl as he had
promised.</p>
<p>When they had been married some time, he goes out for two or three
days to shoot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you,&rsquo; says the wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not quite the thing,&rsquo; answered he;
&lsquo;but perhaps it&rsquo;s better than leaving you at home; but mind
you pull the door after you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, of course,&rsquo; answers the simple wife, and pulls
it so effectually that she lifts it off its hinges and carries it along
with her.</p>
<p>When they had gone some way he looks back and sees her carrying the
door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What on earth are you bringing the door along for!&rsquo; he
cries.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You told me to pull it after me,&rsquo; answers she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, I only meant you to pull it to, to make the house
secure,&rsquo; he says.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If merely pulling it to, made the house secure, how much
securer it must be when I pull it all this way!&rsquo; answers she.</p>
<p>He finds it useless to reason with her, and they go on. At night
they climb up into a tree to sleep, the woman still carrying the door
with her. A band of robbers come and count their gains under the tree;
the woman from sheer weariness, and though she believes it will rouse
the robbers to come and kill them, drops the door upon them. They take
it for an earthquake and run away. The man and his wife then gather up
the money, and are rich for the rest of their lives. <span class=

<p class="first editorial">[A version from Sinigaglia was very like the
last. It only took up the story, however, after the husband and wife
are married. The first silly thing the wife does is the feat of the
&lsquo;brocoli strascinati,&rsquo; as in &lsquo;La Sposa Cece,&rsquo;
No. 2. Some variety is always thrown in in the way of telling. This
wife was represented as having a very sweet voice, and saying,
&lsquo;Si, si, marito mio!&rsquo; in the gentlest and tenderest way in
the world, to everything her husband tells her, though she mismanages
everything so. After the brocoli affair he tells her to cook some beans
for dinner. &lsquo;Si, si, marito mio,&rsquo; she says in her sweet
tone, but takes four beans only and boils them in a pot of water. When
he comes in and asks if the beans are done, she says, &lsquo;Si, si,
marito mio!&rsquo; She says she has cooked two beans apiece, but one
has boiled away, so she will only take one for her share.</p>
<p class="editorial">He finds it impossible to live with her, and goes
away, but she in her simplicity says if he goes away she will go with
him! When he finds he can&rsquo;t prevent this he tells her to pull the
door after her, and the story has the same ending as the last.</p>
<p class="editorial">After tales of simple wives come similar tales of
simple boys. Compare &lsquo;Russian Folktales,&rsquo; pp. 10 and 49. An
analogous incident to the selling of the linen to a statue in the
following is told of a grown-up peasant in Grimm&rsquo;s &lsquo;Der
gute Handel,&rsquo; p. 30, which story is not unlike one called
&lsquo;How the poorest became the richest&rsquo; I have given from the
German-Tirolese province of Vorarlberg at the end of &lsquo;Household
Stories from the Land of H&ouml;fer,&rsquo; a close counterpart of
which I have met in a Roman periodical, told as collected at Modena.
The Italian-Tirolese counterpart bears the name of
&lsquo;Turlul&ugrave;,&rsquo; and resembles the Roman very closely.
There is a place in German Tirol where they not only tell the story,
but point out the <i lang="de">Bildstocklein</i> (the wayside image),
to which the simple boy sold his linen; I cannot recall the place now,
though I remember having occasion to mention it in &lsquo;Traditions of
Tirol&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Monthly Packet.&rsquo; In the German there
is also &lsquo;Der gescheidte Hans,&rsquo; which is somewhat different
in structure; but Scheible, &lsquo;Schaltjahr,&rsquo; i. 493, gives a
story which contains both ways of telling.] <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They say there was once a widow woman who had a very
simple son. Whatever she set him to do he muddled in some way or
other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What am I to do?&rsquo; said the poor mother to a neighbour
one day. &lsquo;The boy eats and drinks, and has to be clothed; what am
I to do if I am to make no profit of him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have kept him at home long enough;&rsquo; answered the
neighbour. &lsquo;Try sending him out, now; maybe that will answer
better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The mother took the advice, and the next time she had got a piece of
linen spun she called her boy, and said to him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I send you out to sell this piece of linen, do you think
you can manage to do it without committing any folly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, mama,&rsquo; answered the booby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You always say &ldquo;yes mama,&rdquo; but you do contrive to
muddle everything all the same,&rsquo; replied the mother. &lsquo;Now,
listen attentively to all I say. Walk straight along the road without
turning to right or left; don&rsquo;t take less than such and such a
price for it. Don&rsquo;t have anything to say to women who chatter;
whether you sell it to anyone you meet by the way, or carry it into the
market, offer it only to some quiet sort of body whom you may see
standing apart, and not gossiping and prating, for such as they will
persuade you to take some sort of a price that won&rsquo;t suit me at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The booby promised to follow these directions very exactly, and
started on his way.</p>
<p>On he walked, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left,
thus passing the turnings which led to the villages, to one or other of
which he ought to have gone. But his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb372" href="#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span>mother had only meant
that he was not to turn off the pathway and lose himself.</p>
<p>Presently he met the wife of the syndic of the next town, who was
driving out with her maids, but had got out to walk a little stretch of
the way, as the day was fine. The syndic&rsquo;s wife was talking
cheerfully with her maids, and when one of them caught sight of the
simpleton, she said to her mistress:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here is the simple son of the poor widow by the
brook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you going to do, my good lad?&rsquo; said the
syndic&rsquo;s wife kindly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not going to tell you, because you were chattering and
gossiping,&rsquo; replied the booby boorishly, and tried to pass
on.</p>
<p>The syndic&rsquo;s wife forgave his boorishness, and added:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see your mother has sent you to sell this piece of linen. I
will buy it of you, and that will save you walking further; put it in
the carriage, and I&rsquo;ll give you so much for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though she had offered him twice as much as his mother had told him
to get for it, he would only answer:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t sell it to you, because you were chattering and
gossiping.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nor could they prevail on him to stop a moment longer.</p>
<p>Further along he came to a statue by the roadside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s one who stands apart and doesn&rsquo;t
chatter,&rsquo; said the booby to himself. &lsquo;This is the one to
sell the linen to.&rsquo; Then aloud to the statue, &lsquo;Will you buy
my linen, good friend?&rsquo; Then to himself. &lsquo;She doesn&rsquo;t
speak, so it&rsquo;s all right.&rsquo; Then to the statue, &lsquo;The
price is so-and-so; have the money ready against I come back, as I have
to go on and buy some yarn for mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On he went and bought the yarn, and then came back to the statue.
Some one passing by meanwhile, and seeing the linen lie there had
picked it up and walked off with it.</p>
<p>Finding it gone, the booby said to himself, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all
right, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span>she&rsquo;s taken it.&rsquo; Then to the statue,
&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the money I told you to have ready against I came
back?&rsquo; As the statue remained silent, the booby began to get
uneasy. &lsquo;My mother will be finely angry if I go back without the
linen or the money,&rsquo; he said to himself. Then to the statue,
&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t give me the money directly I&rsquo;ll hit you
on the head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The booby was as good as his word; lifting his thick rough
walking-stick, he gave the statue such a blow that he knocked the head
off.</p>
<p>But the statue was hollow, and filled with gold coin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s where you keep your money, is it?&rsquo; said
the booby, &lsquo;all right, I can pay myself.&rsquo; So he filled his
pockets with money and went back to his mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look, mama! here&rsquo;s the price of the piece of
linen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; said the mother out loud; but to herself
she said, &lsquo;where can I ever hide all this lot of money? I have
got no place to hide it but in this earthen jar, and if he knows how
much it is worth, he will be letting out the secret to other people,
and I shall be robbed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So she put the money in the earthen jar, and said to the boy:</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve cheated you in making you think that was coin;
it&rsquo;s nothing but a lot of rusty nails;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10143src" href="#xd26e10143" name="xd26e10143src">2</a> but never
mind, you&rsquo;ll know better next time.&rsquo; And she went out to
her work.</p>
<p>While she was gone out to her work there came by an old
rag-merchant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ho! here, rag-merchant!&rsquo; said the booby, who had
acquired a taste for trading. &lsquo;What will you give me for this lot
of rusty nails?&rsquo; and he showed him the jar full of gold coin.</p>
<p>The rag-merchant saw that he had to do with an idiot, so he
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, old nails are not worth very much; but as I&rsquo;m a
good-natured old chap, I&rsquo;ll give you twelve pauls for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>them,&rsquo; because he knew he must offer
enough to seem a prize to the idiot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may have them at that,&rsquo; said the booby. And the
rag-merchant poured the coin out into his sack, and gave the fool the
twelve pauls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look mama, look! I&rsquo;ve sold that lot of old rusty
worthless nails for twelve pauls. Isn&rsquo;t that a good
bargain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sold them for twelve pauls!&rsquo; cried the widow, tearing
her hair, &lsquo;Why, it was a fortune all in gold coin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t help it, mama,&rsquo; replied the booby;
&lsquo;you told me they were rusty nails.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another day she told him to shut the door of the cottage; but as he
went to do it he lifted the door off its hinges. His mother called
after him in an angry voice, which so frightened him that he ran away,
carrying the door on his back.</p>
<p>As he went along, some one to tease him, said, &lsquo;Where did you
steal that door?&rsquo; which frightened him still more, and he climbed
up in a tree with it to hide it.</p>
<p>At night there came a band of robbers under the tree, and counted
out all their gains in large bags of money. The booby was so frightened
at the sight of so many fierce-looking robbers, that he began to
tremble and let go of the door.</p>
<p>The door fell with a bang in the midst of the robbers, who thinking
it must be that the police were upon them, decamped, leaving all their
money behind.</p>
<p>The booby came down from the tree and carried the money home to his
mother, and they became so rich that she was able to appoint a servant
to attend to him, and keep him from doing any more mischief.</p>
<p class="editorial">[After the boys, the girls come in for their share
of hard <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=

daughter and a wife. Grimm has the same, with a slight variation, as
&lsquo;Rumpelstilzchen,&rsquo; p. 219, and the Italian-Tirol Tales give
it as &lsquo;Tarandand&ograve;;&rsquo; the incident on which these two
hinge of a supernatural being giving his help on condition of the
person he favours remembering his name, is of frequent occurrence. I
have met it in two German-Tirolese stories, &lsquo;The Wilder
J&auml;ger and the Baroness,&rsquo; and in &lsquo;Klein-Else&rsquo; in
&lsquo;Household Stories,&rsquo; and in a local tradition told me at
Salzburg, which I have given in &lsquo;Traditions of Tirol,&rsquo; No.
XVI. in &lsquo;Monthly Packet,&rsquo; each time the sprite gets a new
name; in this one it was &lsquo;Hahnenzuckerl.&rsquo; The supernatural
helper delivering the girl from future as well as present labour occurs
in the Spanish equivalent, &lsquo;What Ana saw in the Sunbeam,&rsquo;
in &lsquo;Patra&ntilde;as,&rsquo; but in favour of a good, instead of a
lazy or greedy girl; and so with the girl in the Norse tale of
&lsquo;The Three Aunts.&rsquo; &lsquo;Die faule Spinnerin,&rsquo;
Grimm, p. 495, helps herself to the same end without supernatural
aid.]</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a poor woman who went out to work by the
day. She had one idle, good-for-nothing daughter, who would never do
any work, and cared for nothing but eating, always taking the best of
everything for herself, and not caring how her mother fared.</p>
<p>One day the mother, when she went out to her work, left the girl
some beans to cook for dinner, and some pieces of bacon-rind<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e10191src" href="#xd26e10191" name=
"xd26e10191src">2</a> to stew along with them. When the pieces of
bacon-rind were nicely done, she took them out and <span class="corr"
id="xd26e10194" title="Source: eat">ate</span> them herself, and then
found a pair of dirty old shoe-soles, which she pared in slices, and
put them into the stew for her mother.</p>
<p>When the poor mother came home, not only were there no pieces of
bacon which she could eat, but the beans themselves were rendered so
nasty by the shoe-soles <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href=
"#pb376" name="pb376">376</a>]</span>that she could not eat them
either. Determined to give her daughter a good lesson, once for all, on
this occasion, she took her outside her cottage door, and beat her well
with a stick.</p>
<p>Just as she was administering this chastisement, a farmer<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e10203src" href="#xd26e10203" name=
"xd26e10203src">3</a> came by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you beating this pretty lass for?&rsquo; asked the
man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because she <i>will</i> work so hard at her household duties
that she works on Sundays and holidays the same as common days,&rsquo;
answered the mother, who, bad as her daughter was, yet had not the
heart to give her a bad character.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is the first time I ever heard of a mother beating her
child for doing too much work; the general complaint is that they do
too little. Will you let me have her for a wife? I should like such a
wife as that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo; replied the mother, in order to enhance
her daughter&rsquo;s value; &lsquo;she does all the work of the house,
I can&rsquo;t spare her; what shall I do without her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must give you something to make up for the loss,&rsquo;
replied the merchant; &lsquo;but such a notable wife as this I have
long been in search of, and I must not miss the chance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I cannot spare such a notable daughter, either,&rsquo;
persisted the mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you say if I give you five hundred scudi?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I let her go, it is not because of the five hundred
scudi,&rsquo; said the mother; &lsquo;it is because you seem a husband,
who will really appreciate her; though I don&rsquo;t say five hundred
scudi will not be a help to a poor lone widow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let it be agreed then. I am going now to the fair; when I
come back let the girl be ready, and I&rsquo;ll take her back with
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, when the farmer returned from the fair, he fetched the
girl away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span></p>
<p>When he got home his mother came out to ask how his affairs had
prospered at the fair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Middling well, at the fair,&rsquo; replied the man;
&lsquo;but, by the way, I found a treasure, and I have brought her home
to make her my wife. She is so hardworking that she can&rsquo;t be kept
from working, even on Sundays.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She doesn&rsquo;t look as if there was much work in
her,&rsquo; observed the mother dryly; &lsquo;but if you&rsquo;re
satisfied that&rsquo;s enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All went well enough the first week, because she was not expected to
do much just at first, but at the end of that time the husband had to
go to a distant fair which would keep him absent three weeks. Before he
went he took his new wife up into the store-room, and said, &lsquo;Here
are provisions of all sorts, and you will have all you like to eat and
drink; and here is a quantity of hemp, which you can amuse yourself
with spinning and weaving if you want more employment than merely
keeping the place in order.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he gave her a set of rooms to herself, next the store-chamber,
that there might be no cause of quarrel with the mother-in-law, who, he
knew, was inclined to be jealous of her, and said good-bye.</p>
<p>Left to herself, she did no more work than she could help; all the
nice things she found she cooked and ate, and that was all the work she
did. As to the hemp, she never touched it; nor did she even clean up
the place, or attempt to put it tidy.</p>
<p>When the husband had been gone a fortnight, the mother-in-law came
up to see how she was going on, and when she saw the hemp untouched,
and the place in disorder, she said, &lsquo;So this is how you go on
when your husband is away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mind your affairs, and I&rsquo;ll mind
mine,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10250src" href="#xd26e10250"
name="xd26e10250src">4</a> answered the wife, and the mother-in-law
went away offended.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was true that in eight days the husband would be
back, and might expect to see something <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb378" href="#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>done, so she took up
a lot of hemp and began trying to spin it; but, as she had no idea of
how to do it, she went on in the most absurd way imaginable with
it.</p>
<p>As she stood on the top of the outside staircase, twisting it this
way and that, there passed three deformed fairies. One was lame, and
one squinted,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10259src" href="#xd26e10259"
name="xd26e10259src">5</a> and one had her head all on one side,
because she had a fish-bone stuck in her throat.</p>
<p>The three fairies called out to ask what she was doing, and when she
said &lsquo;spinning,&rsquo; the one who squinted laughed so much that
her eyes came quite right, and the one who had a bone stuck in her
throat laughed so much that the bone came out, and her head became
straight again like other people&rsquo;s, and when the lame one saw the
others laughing so much, she ran so fast to see what it was that her
lameness was cured.</p>
<p>Then the three fairies said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since she has cured us of our ailments, we must go in and do
her a good turn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they went in and took the hemp and span it, and wove it, and did
as much in the six remaining days as any human being could have done in
twenty years; moreover, they cleaned up everything, and made everything
look spick-and-span new.</p>
<p>Then they gave her a bag of walnuts, saying, &lsquo;in half an hour
your husband will be home; go to bed and put this bag of walnuts under
your back. When he comes in say you have worked so hard that all your
bones are out of joint; then move the bag of walnuts and they will make
a noise, <i>c-r-r-r-r</i>, and he will think it is your bones which are
loosened, and will say you must never work again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the husband came home his mother went out to meet him,
saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you I did not think there was much work in your
&ldquo;treasure.&rdquo; When you go up you&rsquo;ll see what a fine
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>mess the place is all in; and as to the hemp,
you had better have left it locked up, for a fine mess she has made of
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the husband went up and found the place all in shining order,
and so much hemp spun and woven as could scarcely be got through in
twenty years. But the wife was laid up in bed.</p>
<p>When the husband came near the bed she moved the bag of walnuts and
they went <i>c-r-r-r-r</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have done a lot of work indeed!&rsquo; said the
husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied the wife; &lsquo;but I have put all my
bones out of joint; only hear how they rumble!&rsquo; and she moved the
walnuts again, and they went <i>c-r-r-r-r</i>. &lsquo;It will be
sometime before I am about again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear!&rsquo; said the husband; &lsquo;only
think of such a treasure of a wife being laid up by such marvellous
diligence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And to his mother he said: &lsquo;A mother-in-law has never a good
word for her daughter-in-law; what you told me was all pure
invention.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But to the wife he said: &lsquo;Mind I will never have you do any
work again as long as you live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So from that day forth she had no work to do, but ate and drank and
amused herself from morning till night. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a mother who had a daughter so greedy that
she did not know what to do with her. Everything in the house she would
eat up. When the poor mother came home from work there was nothing
left.</p>
<p>But the girl had a godfather-wolf.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10319src" href="#xd26e10319" name="xd26e10319src">2</a> The wolf
had a frying-pan, and the girl&rsquo;s mother was too poor to possess
such an article; whenever she wanted to fry anything she sent her
daughter to the wolf to borrow his frying-pan, and he always sent a
nice omelette in it by way of not sending it empty. But the girl was so
greedy and so selfish that she not only always ate the omelette by the
way, but when she took the frying-pan back she filled it with all
manner of nasty things.</p>
<p>At last the wolf got hurt at this way of going on, and he came to
the house to inquire into the matter.</p>
<p>Godfather-wolf met the mother on the step of the door, returning
from work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you like my omelettes?&rsquo; asked the wolf.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure they would be good if made by our
godfather-wolf,&rsquo; replied the poor woman; &lsquo;but I never had
the honour of tasting them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never tasted them! Why, how many times have you sent to
borrow my frying-pan?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am ashamed to say how many times; a great many,
certainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And every time I sent you an omelette in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never one reached me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then that hussey of a girl must have eaten them by the
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The poor mother, anxious to screen her daughter, burst into all
manner of excuses, but the wolf now saw how it all was. To make sure,
however, he added: &lsquo;The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381"
href="#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span>omelettes would have been
better had the frying-pan not always been full of such nasty things. I
did my best always to clean it, but it was not easy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, godfather-wolf, you are joking! I always cleaned it,
inside and out, as bright as silver, every time before I sent it
back!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The wolf now knew all, and he said no more to the mother; but the
next day, when she was out, he came back.</p>
<p>When the girl saw him coming she was so frightened and
self-convicted that she ran under the bed to hide herself.</p>
<p>But to the wolf it was as easy to go under a bed as anywhere else;
so under he went, and he dragged her out and devoured her. And that was
the end of the Greedy Daughter.</p>

<p class="editorial">After the faults of the young, the sins of the old

trace of similarity.</p>
<p class="editorial">In Scheible&rsquo;s &lsquo;Schaltjahr,&rsquo; vol.
i. pp. 169&ndash;71, is a very quaint miser story, bringing in also an
instance of wolf-transformation, which is said to have happened
&lsquo;in Italy,&rsquo; to a certain Herr v. Schotenberg, on August 14,
1798. He had seized a poor peasant&rsquo;s only cow for a debt, and
when, in punishment, all his own cows were struck dead, he accused the
peasant&rsquo;s wife of bewitching them, and threatened to have her
burnt. The peasant&rsquo;s wife answered that it was the judgment of
God, not hers; and upon that he turned to the crucifix in the farmyard,
saying: &lsquo;Oh, you did it, did you? then you may go and eat the
carrion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>you have made, with the dogs.&rsquo; Then he
took out his pistol, shot an arm off the crucifix, and flung it on to
the heap of dead cows, saying, &lsquo;Now one piece of carrion lies
with the rest!&rsquo; &lsquo;Albeit it was only a wooden image,&rsquo;
says the account, &lsquo;yet it was of God in Heaven that he spoke, who
punished him on the spot by turning him into a dog.&rsquo; The portrait
which accompanies the story is quaint, too, having a human face, with
wolfish, erect ears, and the rest of the body like a dog. He wore at
the time a fur cloak, of pale yellow with black spots, and that is how
the dog&rsquo;s fur appeared; and he had to eat carrion all his life,
and follow his good wife about, wherever she went.]</p>

<p class="first">They say there was once an old man who had so much
money he didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it. He had cellars and
cellars, where all the floors were strewn with gold; but the house was
all tumbling down, because he would not spend a penny in repairing it;
and for all food he took nothing all day but a crust of bread and a
glass of water.</p>
<p>He was always afraid lest some one should come to rob him of his
wealth, so he seldom so much as spoke to anyone.</p>
<p>One day, however, a busy, talkative neighbour would have her say out
with him, and among other things she said: &lsquo;How can you go on
living in that ugly old house all alone now? Why don&rsquo;t you take a
wife?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A wife!&rsquo; replied the old miser; &lsquo;how can <i>I</i>
take a wife? How am I to afford to keep a wife, I should like to
know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; persisted the loquacious neighbour;
&lsquo;you&rsquo;ve got plenty of money, you know. And how much better
you&rsquo;d be if you had a wife. Do you mean to tell me, now, you
wouldn&rsquo;t be much better off with one? Now answer me
fairly.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=
"pb383">383</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if I must speak the truth, as you are so urgent for an
answer,&rsquo; replied the old miser, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to say
I haven&rsquo;t often thought I should like a wife; but I am waiting
till I find one who can live upon air.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10386src" href="#xd26e10386" name="xd26e10386src">2</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, maybe there might be such an one even as you
say,&rsquo; returned the busy neighbour; &lsquo;though she might not be
easy to find.&rsquo; And she said no more for that day.</p>
<p>She went, however, to a young woman who lived opposite, and said:
&lsquo;If you want a rich husband I will find you one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure I should like a rich husband,&rsquo; replied the
young woman; &lsquo;who would not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, then,&rsquo; continued the neighbour; &lsquo;I
will tell you what to do. You have only, every day at dinner-time, to
stand at the window and suck in the air, and move your lips as if you
were eating. But eat nothing; take nothing into your mouth but air. The
old miser who lives opposite wants a wife who can live on air; and if
he thinks you can do this he will marry you. And when you are once
installed it&rsquo;ll be odd if you don&rsquo;t find means, in the
midst of so much money, to lay hold of enough to get a dinner every day
without working for it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young woman thanked her friend for the advice, and next day,
when the bells rang at noon, she threw open the window and stood
sucking in the air, and then moving her lips as if she was eating. This
she did several days.</p>
<p>At last the old miser came across under the window, and said to her:
&lsquo;What are you doing at the window there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s dinner-time, and I&rsquo;m
taking my dinner? Don&rsquo;t interrupt me!&rsquo; replied the young
neighbour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, excuse me,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10406src" href=
"#xd26e10406" name="xd26e10406src">3</a> I don&rsquo;t see you are
eating anything, though your lips move.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O! I live upon air; I take nothing but air,&rsquo; replied
the young woman; and she went on with her mock munching. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;You live upon air, do you? Then you&rsquo;re just the wife
I&rsquo;m looking for. Will you come down and marry me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>As this was just what she wanted she did not keep him waiting, and
soon they were married and she was installed in the miser&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>But it was not so easy to get at the money as she had thought. At
first the miser would not let her go near his cellars; but as he spent
so much time down there she said she could not be deprived of his
company for so long, she must come down too.</p>
<p>All the time she was down with him the miser held both her hands in
his, as if he was full of affection for her; but in reality it was to
make sure she did not touch any of his money.</p>
<p>She, however, bought some pitch, and put it on the soles of her
shoes, and as she walked about in the gold plenty of it stuck to her
shoes; and when she came up again she took the gold off her shoes, and
sent her maid to the <i>trattoria</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10424src" href="#xd26e10424" name="xd26e10424src">4</a> for the
most delicious dinners. Shut up in a room apart they fared
sumptuously&mdash;she and her maid. But every day at midday she let the
miser see her taking her fancied dinner of air.</p>
<p>This went on for long, because the miser had so much gold that he
never missed the few pieces that stuck to her shoes every day.</p>
<p>But at last there came a Carneval Thursday,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10432src" href="#xd26e10432" name="xd26e10432src">5</a> when the
maid had brought home an extra fine dinner; and as they were an extra
length of time over this extra number of dishes and glasses, the old
miser, always suspicious, began to guess there must be something wrong;
and to find it out he instituted a scrutiny into every room in the
crazy house. Thus he came at last to the room where his wife and her
maid were dining sumptuously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is how you live on air, is it?&rsquo; he roared, red
with fury. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but on Carneval Thursday,&rsquo; replied the wife,
&lsquo;one may have a little extra indulgence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you tell me you have not had a private dinner every
day?&rsquo; shouted the excited miser.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I have,&rsquo; replied the wife, not liking to tell a
direct falsehood, &lsquo;how do you know it is not with my own money?
Tell me, have you missed any of yours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The miser was only the more angry at her way of putting the
question, because he could not say he had actually missed the money;
yet he was convinced it was his money she had been spending.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do I know it is not your money, do you ask?&rsquo; he
thundered; &lsquo;because if you had had any money of your own you
would never have come to live here, you would not have married
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But weak as he was with his bread and water diet, the excitement was
too much for him. As he said these words a convulsion seized him, and
he fell down dead.</p>
<p>Thus all his riches came into possession of the wife.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was an old woman who had three sons, and from
her stinginess she could not bear that anyone should have anything to
eat. One day the eldest son came to her and said he must take a
wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you must, you must,&rsquo; replied the miserly mother.
&lsquo;But mind she is one who brings a great dowry, eats little, and
can work all day long.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386"
href="#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span></p>
<p>The eldest son went his way and told the girl he was going to marry
his mother&rsquo;s hard terms. As the girl loved him very much, she
made no objection, and he married her, and brought her home.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e10467src" href="#xd26e10467" name=
"xd26e10467src">2</a></p>
<p>The first morning the mother-in-law came before it was light, and
knocked at the door, and bid the bride get up and come down to her
work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very hard for you,&rsquo; said the young husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well! I promised to submit to it before we
married,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t break my
promise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So she got up and went down and helped her mother-in-law to do the
work of the house. By twelve o&rsquo;clock she was very hungry; but the
miserly mother-in-law only took out an apple and a halfpenny roll, and
gave her half of each for all her food. She took it without a murmur;
and so she went on every day, working hard, and eating little, and
making no complaint.</p>
<p>By-and-by the second son came and told his mother that he was going
to take a wife. The mother made the same conditions, and the wife
submitted to them with equally good grace.</p>
<p>Then the third son came and said he too must take a wife. To him the
old woman made the same terms; but he could not find a wife who would
submit to them for his sake. The girl he wanted to marry, however, was
very lively and spirited, and she said at last&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind the conditions; let&rsquo;s marry, and we&rsquo;ll
get through the future somehow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then they married. When her son brought home this wife, and the old
woman found she had no dowry, she was in a great fury; but it was too
late to help it.</p>
<p>The first morning, when she knocked at their door to wake her, she
called out&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; though she knew well enough.</p>
<p>The mother-in-law answered, &lsquo;Time to get up!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Oibo!</i>&rsquo; exclaimed the young wife.
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t imagine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href=
"#pb387" name="pb387">387</a>]</span>I&rsquo;m going to get up in the
middle of the night like this! I shall get up when I please, and not
before.&rsquo; Then she turned to her husband, and said, &lsquo;Just
for her bothering me like this I shan&rsquo;t get up till twelve
o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; Neither did she.</p>
<p>The house was now filled with the old woman&rsquo;s lamentations.
&lsquo;This woman upsets everything! This woman will be the ruin of us
all!&rsquo; she kept exclaiming. But the third wife paid no heed, and
dressed herself up smart, and amused herself, and did no work at
all.</p>
<p>When supper-time came the old woman took out her apple and her
halfpenny loaf, and cut them in four quarters, serving a bit all
round.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; said the third wife, stooping to
look at it, as if she could not make it out, and without taking it in
her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s your supper,&rsquo; replied the mother-in-law.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My supper! do you think I&rsquo;ve come to my second
childhood, to be helped to driblets like that!&rsquo; and she filliped
it to the other end of the room.</p>
<p>Then she went to her husband and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we must do; we must have false keys
made, and get into the store-closet<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10515src" href="#xd26e10515" name="xd26e10515src">3</a> and take
what we want.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though the mother-in-law was so miserly, there was good provision of
everything in the store-closet; and so with the false keys she took
flour and lard and ham, and they had plenty of everything. One day she
had made a delicious cake of curdled sheep&rsquo;s milk,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e10520src" href="#xd26e10520" name=
"xd26e10520src">4</a> and she gave a woman a halfpenny to take it to
the baker&rsquo;s to bake, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Make haste, and bring it back, that we may get through eating
it while the old woman is at mass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was not quick enough, however, and the mother-in-law came in
just about the same time that the cake came back from the
baker&rsquo;s. The third son&rsquo;s wife to hide <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name="pb388">388</a>]</span>it
from her caught it up and put it under her petticoats, but it burned
her ankles, so that she was obliged to bring it out. Then the
mother-in-law understood what had been going on, and went into such a
fury, the house could not hold her.</p>
<p>Then the third son&rsquo;s wife sent the same woman to the chemist,
saying, &lsquo;get me three pauls of quicksilver.&rsquo; And she took
the quicksilver, when the mother-in-law was asleep, and put it into her
mouth and ears, so that she could not storm or scold any more. But
after a time she died of vexation; and then they opened wide the
store-room, and lived very comfortably.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a poor man who went about from door to
door begging his bread. He came to the cottage of a poor peasant and
said: &lsquo;Give me something, for the love of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The peasant&rsquo;s wife said, &lsquo;Good man, go away; I have
nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the poor man said, &lsquo;Leave me out something against I come
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The peasant&rsquo;s wife answered, &lsquo;The most I can give you is
a single chick-pea.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10558src" href=

<p>&lsquo;Very well; that will do,&rsquo; replied the poor man;
&lsquo;only mind the hen doesn&rsquo;t eat it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The peasant&rsquo;s wife was as good as her word, and put out a
chick-pea on the dresser against the beggar came by next time. While
her back was turned, however, the hen came in and gobbled it up.
Presently after the beggar came by.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the chick-pea you promised me?&rsquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! I put it out for you, but the hen gobbled it
up!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this he assumed an air of terrible authority, and said:
&lsquo;Did I not tell you to beware lest the hen should eat it? Now,
you must give me either the pea or the hen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As it was impossible for the peasant&rsquo;s wife now to give him
the pea, she was obliged to give him the hen.</p>
<p>The beggar, therefore, took the hen, and went to another
cottage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good woman,&rsquo; he said to the peasant&rsquo;s wife;
&lsquo;can you be so good as to take care of this hen for
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Willingly enough!&rsquo; said the peasant&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here it is then,&rsquo; said the beggar; &lsquo;but mind the
pig doesn&rsquo;t get it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never fear!&rsquo; said the peasant&rsquo;s wife; and the
poor man went his way.</p>
<p>Next day the beggar came back and claimed his hen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear me!&rsquo; said the peasant&rsquo;s wife,
&lsquo;while my back was turned, the pig gobbled it up!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Assuming an air of terrible authority, the man said:
&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I warn you to beware lest the pig gobbled it up?
Now, you must give me either the hen or the pig.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the peasant&rsquo;s wife couldn&rsquo;t give him the hen, she was
obliged to give him the pig. So the poor man took the pig and went his
way.</p>
<p>He came now to another cottage, and said to the peasant&rsquo;s
wife: &lsquo;Good woman, can you take care of this pig a little space
for me?&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name=
"pb390">390</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Willingly!&rsquo; said the peasant&rsquo;s wife; &lsquo;put
him in the yard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mind the calf doesn&rsquo;t get at him,&rsquo; said the
man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never fear,&rsquo; said the peasant&rsquo;s wife, and the
beggar went his way.</p>
<p>The next day he came back and claimed his pig.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; answered the peasant&rsquo;s wife;
&lsquo;while I wasn&rsquo;t looking, the calf got at the pig, and
seized it by the throat, and killed it, and trampled it all to
pieces.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Assuming an air of terrible authority, the beggar said: &lsquo;Did I
not warn you to beware lest the calf got at it? Now you must give me
the pig or the calf.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the poor woman could not give him the pig, she was forced to give
him the calf. The beggar took the calf and went away.</p>
<p>He went on to another cottage, and said to the peasant&rsquo;s wife:
&lsquo;Good woman, can you take care of this calf for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Willingly!&rsquo; said the peasant&rsquo;s wife; &lsquo;put
it in the yard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The poor man put the calf in the yard; but he said: &lsquo;I see you
have a sick daughter there in bed; mind she doesn&rsquo;t desire the
calf.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never fear!&rsquo; said the peasant&rsquo;s wife; and the man
went his way.</p>
<p>He was no sooner gone, however, than the sick daughter arose, and
saying, &lsquo;Little heart! little heart!<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10621src" href="#xd26e10621" name="xd26e10621src">3</a> I must
have you,&rsquo; she went down into the yard and killed the calf, and
took out its heart and ate it.</p>
<p>The next day the beggar man came back and claimed the calf.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; said the peasant&rsquo;s wife, &lsquo;while
I wasn&rsquo;t looking, my sick daughter got up and killed the calf,
and ate its heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Assuming an air of terrible authority, the beggar said: &lsquo;Did
not I warn you not to let the sick daughter get at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name="pb391">391</a>]</span>the
calf? Now, either calf or maiden I must have; make haste with your
choice; calf or maiden, one or the other!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10633src" href="#xd26e10633" name="xd26e10633src">4</a></p>
<p>But the poor woman could not get back the calf, seeing it was dead,
and she was resolved not to give up her daughter. So she said: &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t give you the calf, because it is dead. So I must give you
my daughter, only if I went to take her now while she&rsquo;s awake,
she would make such a fuss you would never get her along; so leave me
your sack, that while she&rsquo;s asleep I may put her in it, and then
when you come back you can have her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the beggar left his sack and went away. As soon as he was gone
the peasant&rsquo;s wife took the sack and put some stones at the
bottom, to make it heavy, and thrust in a ferocious mad dog; then
having made fast the mouth of the sack, she stood it up against the
wall.</p>
<p>Next day the beggar came back and asked for his sack.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There it is against the wall,&rsquo; said the peasant&rsquo;s
wife.</p>
<p>So the beggar put it on his shoulder and went away.</p>
<p>As soon as he got home, he opened the sack to take out the maiden;
but the ferocious mad dog rushed out upon him and killed him.

<h2 class="main"><i>DOCTOR GRILLO.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Doctor Grillo was a physician who had made himself a
great name throughout his whole country, so that he was sent for and
consulted from far and wide, and everybody looked up to him as a very
wise man, whose word was final on any question of medicine. The
discovery that &lsquo;no man is a hero to his valet&rsquo; was made
long before the idea so found expression in the seventeenth century;
Doctor Grillo had a man-servant who chose to entertain a very different
notion of his merits and powers from that of the rest of the world; and
in time, from undervaluing his attainments, he came to conceive the
belief that he could himself do just as well as his master.</p>
<p>One day, when the Doctor was out, this serving-man took into his
head to roll up into a great bundle his doctor&rsquo;s gown and
cap,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10668src" href="#xd26e10668" name=
"xd26e10668src">1</a> a number of prescriptions, and a quantity of
bottles, and with these he stole away and betook himself to a far
country, where he gave himself out for the famed Doctor Grillo.</p>
<p>Just at the time he arrived, the queen of the country was in great
suffering, nor could any native professor of medicine succeed in
benefiting her. Naturally the services of the great Doctor Grillo were
put in request in her behalf, as soon as his cunning servant had given
himself out as the owner of his world-wide reputation, and fortune
favoured him in his two earliest attempts. Suffice it to say, he
succeeded in satisfying her requirements by a kind of luck and from
that day forward his fortune was made, justifying the Italian saying,
&lsquo;An ounce of good fortune furthers one more than a pound of
knowledge.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10673src" href=
"#xd26e10673" name="xd26e10673src">2</a> Everywhere he was now called
in, and though he prescribed his remedies all higgledypiggledy, without
science or experience, not more of his patients died than those of
other mediciners. The people were, therefore, quite satisfied
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name=
"pb393">393</a>]</span>that when Doctor Grillo had prescribed the best
had been done that human skill could afford.</p>
<p>By-and-by it came to the ears of the real Doctor Grillo that a quack
and impostor was wearing his laurels; nor did he sooner hear the news
than he set out to confront him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beware good people! What are you doing?&rsquo; was his say.
&lsquo;This man knows no more of medicine than one of yourselves; you
will all die if you trust to him. He is no Doctor Grillo. I am Doctor
Grillo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But all the people laughed in his face, filled as they were with the
prepossession of their first impressions, and they began to drive him
out of their midst; but he protested so loudly, &lsquo;I am Doctor
Grillo,&rsquo; that a wiseacre<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10684src"
href="#xd26e10684" name="xd26e10684src">3</a> in the crowd thought to
win for himself a reputation for discernment by insisting that he
should have a trial.</p>
<p>It happened that the daughter of the Chief Judge was at that time
stricken with fever, and as he had observed in the language and manners
of the new Doctor Grillo more traces of learning and
refinement<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10689src" href="#xd26e10689"
name="xd26e10689src">4</a> than in the first arrived of the name, he
willingly agreed that the case should be submitted to him for
treatment. His wife had, however, just before sent for the false Doctor
Grillo, so that both arrived in the sick-room at the same moment; and
loud and long was the dispute between husband wife, master and servant,
as to which doctor should approach the patient. By the time the husband
had carried his point, and the real physician entered upon his
functions, the fever had got such hold of the sufferer that no medicine
more availed, and the girl succumbed to the consequences of the delay
in administering the most ordinary remedies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was in the hands of the real Doctor Grillo that she
had died. The one proof of his identity which had been granted had gone
against him, and the popular mind was quite satisfied that it was he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name=
"pb394">394</a>]</span>was the impostor. As the pompous funeral of the
Judge&rsquo;s daughter brought all the circumstances to the minds of
the people, the feeling against him gathered and grew; and when at last
one more mischievous and malicious than the rest proposed that he
should be driven out of the community, the idea met with such a ready
response that he would certainly not have escaped with his life from
the yells and stone-throwing<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10696src" href=
"#xd26e10696" name="xd26e10696src">5</a> of the infuriated populace,
had not his retreat been protected by the more peaceably disposed
citizens.</p>
<p>But the false Doctor Grillo remained thenceforward in undisturbed
possession of the fame and fortune attaching to the name he had
filched.</p>

&lsquo;Berretta,&rsquo; (also written &lsquo;biretta&rsquo;) is used
for any kind of cap worn by men or boys. It would appear that no kind
of head-covering except a hood to the cloak, enabling the wearer to
cover the head, or leave it bare at pleasure, was in common use in
Italy before the sixteenth century, though the &lsquo;berretta&rsquo;
is mentioned in documents as part of ecclesiastical, particularly of
the pontifical, dress, as early as the tenth century. The round
&lsquo;berretta&rsquo; coming to be commonly used by the people, their
superiors adopted the quadrated form, which, with some modifications,
is that still adopted by the Catholic clergy. Graduates and doctors
were privileged to wear it, hence its use by Doctor Grillo; and though
monks generally are not, some of those engaged in preaching and
teaching have a special permission to do so. The Superior of the
Theatine Convent of Naples alone, among all superiors of nuns, has the
privilege of wearing the &lsquo;berretta.&rsquo; Orsola Benincasa, the
founder, was called to Rome that the Pope (Gregory XIII., 1576) might
examine whether the reputation she had acquired for learning and piety
was well founded. Not only was the Pope well satisfied with her, but
St. Philip Neri also gave her many tokens of approval, and, among
others, in his playful way, put his &lsquo;berretta&rsquo; on her head.
This honour has been commemorated by her successors retaining its
use.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e10668src">&uarr;</a></p>

&lsquo;Sassata,&rsquo; in Italian, has a more terrible significance
than &lsquo;stone-throwing,&rsquo; in English, conveys. The art of
throwing and slinging stones with dexterity and accuracy of aim would
seem to have been as favourite a pastime among the peasantry in Italy
and Spain as archery among our own. For the purposes of the present
volume, it needs only to allude to the Roman development of the
practice. P. Bresciani, who has taken more pains than any writer of the
present age in illustrating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href=
"#pb395" name="pb395">395</a>]</span>the local customs of Rome, tells
us the &lsquo;sassate&rsquo; continued a favourite diversion of the
youth of Rome almost down to our own day, and it was only by the most
strenuous and vigorous measures that Cardinal Consalvi was enabled to
put an end to it; being impelled thereto by the barbarous tone of
feeling it engendered, and the frequent casualties resulting from it.
The most idle and dissolute raggamuffins of the Monti and Trastevere
quarters were among the most dexterous of marksmen. Whenever they aimed
a throw, &lsquo;<span lang="it">fosse di fionda o fosse di
soprammano</span>&rsquo; (whether from a sling or from the hand) they
were sure to hit the mark; so that any one of them might have written,
like the Greek archer on his arrow, &lsquo;for the right eye of
Philip,&rsquo; on his &lsquo;ciotto.&rsquo; (&lsquo;Ciotto&rsquo; is a
stone such as would be used for throwing from a sling, and thus
&lsquo;ciottolo&rsquo; means equally a road made with rough stones and
a &lsquo;sassata.&rsquo; What is more to our present purpose is, that
&lsquo;ciotto&rsquo; means also &lsquo;lame,&rsquo; suggesting how
often persons may have been lamed by &lsquo;sassate&rsquo;). It is said
that in the Balearic islands, it was the custom for mothers to tie the
meals of their children to a branch of a tree, and none got anything to
eat till he had hit the string with a stone, and thus they were trained
to &lsquo;fiondeggiare&rsquo; (to throw from a sling) perfectly. The
Roman raggamuffins, instead of their food, used to have for their mark
the features of donna Lucrezia and Marforio, and they
&lsquo;ciottolavanle&rsquo; (pelted them) with stones from far and
near. At other times their aim would be directed against a tuft of
herbage dangling down from the arches of the aqueducts of Nero or
Claudius, nor would they rest from their aiming till they had rooted it
out with their stones. Their highest ambition was to direct a stone
right through one of the small window-openings in the loftiest range at
the Coliseum. After such practice, we may well believe the stones fell
true when they had a living adversary before them.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">&lsquo;And as it is the evil custom of the
sons of Adam to strive one against the other, and for the excitement of
contention every village loves to keep up warfare with its next
neighbouring village, so the &ldquo;Rioni&rdquo; of Rome delighted in
trials of skill one against the other. Thus on every holiday a hundred
or two of Montegiani and Trasteverini were to be found arrayed against
each other, and all arranged in due order of battle, with its
skirmishers and reconnoitring parties, its van-guard and rear-guard.
One side would take the Aventine for its base of operations, and
another the Palatine&#8202;&hellip;.&rsquo; After describing very
graphically the tactics in vogue, our author goes on to say, &lsquo;The
adults of both factions stood by the while and backed up the boys, and
often the strife which had begun as boys&rsquo; pastime ended in
serious maiming of grown up men. Hence, not a holiday passed but some
mother had to mourn over a son brought home to her with a broken head
or an eye knocked out; or some wife over a husband riddled
(sforacchiato) with wounds&#8202;&hellip;.&rsquo; Hence it was that
Cardinal Consalvi, as we have seen, put an end to such rough
play.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e10696src">&uarr;</a></p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a miller who got into difficulties, and
could not pay his rent. The landlord sent to him a great many times to
say that if he could not pay his rent he must go out; but as he paid no
attention to the notice, the landlord went himself at last, and told
him he must go. The miller pleaded that his difficulties were only
temporary, and that if he would give him but a little time he would
make it all straight. The landlord, however, was pitiless, and said he
had waited long enough, and now he had come to put an end to it;
adding, &lsquo;Mind, this is my last word: If you do not go out
to-night peaceably, I shall send some one to-morrow to turn you out by
force.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he turned to leave, after pronouncing this sentence, he met the
miller&rsquo;s daughter coming back from the stream where she had been
washing. &lsquo;Who is this buxom lass?&rsquo; inquired the
landlord.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is my daughter Nina,&rsquo; answered the miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A fine girl she is too,&rsquo; replied the landlord.
&lsquo;And I tell you what, miller, listen to me; give Nina to me, and
I will not only forgive you the debt, but will make over the mill and
the homestead to you, to be your own property for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me a proper document to that effect, duly signed by your
own hand,&rsquo; replied the miller, with a twinkle in his eye,
&lsquo;and I will give you &ldquo;Nina.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The landlord went back into the house, and taking two sheets of
paper drew up first a formal quittance of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb397" href="#pb397" name="pb397">397</a>]</span>the back rent, and
then a conveyance of the mill and homestead absolutely to the miller
and to his heirs for ever. These he handed to the miller; and then he
said, &lsquo;To-night, an hour before sundown, I will send for
&ldquo;Nina.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said the miller; &lsquo;you shall have
&ldquo;Nina,&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; and so they parted.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e10737" title=
"Not in source">&lsquo;</span>An hour before sundown a servant came
with a carriage to fetch &ldquo;Nina&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nina&rdquo;?&rsquo; said the servant.
&lsquo;Master has sent me to fetch
&ldquo;Nina.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the stable&mdash;take her!&rsquo; answered the miller.</p>
<p>In the stable was nothing to be seen but a very lean old donkey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here but an old donkey,&rsquo;
exclaimed the servant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, that&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nina,&rdquo; so take
her,&rsquo; replied the miller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But this can&rsquo;t be what master meant me to fetch!&rsquo;
expostulated the servant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you got to say to it?&rsquo; replied the miller.
&lsquo;Your master told you to fetch &ldquo;Nina;&rdquo; we always call
our donkey &ldquo;Nina;&rdquo; so take her, and be off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The servant saw there was nothing to be gained by disputing, so he
took the donkey and went home. When he got back, his master had got
company with him, so he did not know what to say about the donkey. But
his master seeing he was come back, took it for granted the business
was done; and calling him to him privately said, &lsquo;Take
&ldquo;Nina&rdquo; upstairs into the best bedroom and light a fire, and
give her some supper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take her<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10759src" href=
"#xd26e10759" name="xd26e10759src">1</a> upstairs into the best
bedroom!&rsquo; exclaimed the man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes! do what you&rsquo;re told, and don&rsquo;t repeat my
words.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The servant could not venture to say any more; so he took the donkey
up into the best bedroom, and lit a fire, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb398" href="#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>and put some supper
there. As soon as his company was gone, the master called the
servant&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is &ldquo;Nina&rdquo; upstairs?&rsquo; asked he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Si, Signore; she&rsquo;s lying before the fire,&rsquo;
answered the servant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you take some supper up? I&rsquo;ll have my supper up
there with &ldquo;Nina.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Si, Signore,&rsquo; replied the servant, and he turned away
to laugh, for he thought his master had gone mad.</p>
<p>The landlord went upstairs; but it had now grown dark, so he groped
his way to the fireplace, and there sure enough was &lsquo;Nina,&rsquo;
the donkey, lying down, and as he stroked her he said, &lsquo;What fine
soft hair you&rsquo;ve got, Nina!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Presently the servant brought the lights; and when he saw the dirty
old worn-out donkey, and understood what a trick the miller had played
off on him, it may be imagined how furious he was.</p>
<p>The next day, as soon as the courts were opened, he went before the
judge, and told all the tale. Then the miller came too, and told his;
but the judge examined the documents, and pronounced that the miller
was in the right; for his part of the contract was that he was to
deliver over &lsquo;Nina,&rsquo; and he had delivered over
&lsquo;Nina.&rsquo; There was no evidence that any other
&lsquo;Nina&rsquo; was intended but &lsquo;Nina&rsquo; the donkey, and
so the miller remained in undisputed possession of the mill.</p>
<p>And that is the truth, for it actually happened as I have told you.

purposed misunderstanding of the story, meaning &lsquo;that one,&rsquo;
&lsquo;such an one as that!&rsquo; in the feminine gender; and the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A mother and daughter lived alone in a cottage. The
mother was old and came to die; the daughter was turned out of house
and home.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10795src" href="#xd26e10795" name=
"xd26e10795src">2</a> An ugly hunchback, who was a tailor, came by and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is your name, my pretty girl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They call me la Buona Grazia,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10802src" href="#xd26e10802" name="xd26e10802src">3</a> answered
the girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, la Buona Grazia, I&rsquo;ve got twenty scudi a month,
will you come with me and be my wife?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl was starving, and didn&rsquo;t know where to set her foot,
so she thought she could not afford to refuse; but she went along with
a very bad grace, for she did not feel at all happy at the idea of
marrying the ugly old hunchback.</p>
<p>When the hunchback saw how unhappy she was, he thought, &lsquo;This
will never do. She&rsquo;s too young and too pretty to care for me. I
must keep her locked up, and then when she sees no one else at all, she
will at last be glad even of my company.&rsquo; So he went all the
errands himself, and never let her go out except to Mass, and then he
took her to the church, and watched her all the time, and brought her
back himself. The windows he whitened all over, so that she
couldn&rsquo;t see out into the street, and there he kept her with the
door locked on her, and she was very miserable.</p>
<p>So it went on for three years. But there was a dirty little window
of a lumber room which, as it only gave a look out on to the
court,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10813src" href="#xd26e10813" name=
"xd26e10813src">4</a> he had not whitened. As she happened to look out
here one day a stranger stood leaning on the balcony of the court, for
part of the house was an inn, and he had just arrived.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you looking for, my pretty girl?&rsquo; said the
stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O! nothing particular; only I&rsquo;m locked up here, and I
just looked out for a change.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb400" href="#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Locked up! who has locked you up?&rsquo; asked the
stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An old hunchback, who&rsquo;s going to marry me,&rsquo; said
the girl, almost crying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t seem much pleased at the idea of being
married,&rsquo; answered the stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not likely that I should, to such a husband!&rsquo;
returned the girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you like to get away from him?&rsquo; asked the
stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t I!&rsquo; heartily exclaimed the girl;
&lsquo;but it&rsquo;s impossible to manage that, as I&rsquo;m locked
in,&rsquo; she added sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not so difficult as you think,&rsquo; rejoined the
stranger. &lsquo;Most likely there&rsquo;s some picture or other on
your wall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes! a great big one with the fair Giuditta just ready
with her pouch<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10838src" href="#xd26e10838"
name="xd26e10838src">5</a> to put Lofferno&rsquo;s head in,&rsquo;
answered the girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right. You make a big hole behind the picture on your
side, and when I hear by the sound where you are, I&rsquo;ll make one
on mine. And when our two holes meet, you can come through.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s a capital plan; but the hunchback will soon
come after me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, I will see to that; let&rsquo;s make the hole
first?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, I rely upon you, and will set to work
immediately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me first how I am to call you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They always call me Buona Grazia.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very nice name. Good-bye, and we&rsquo;ll set to
work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>La Buona Grazia ran and unhooked the picture, and set to work to
make a hole with all the available tools she could find; and the
stranger, as soon as he had ascertained by the noise where she was at
work, set to also. It turned out to be only a partition,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e10858src" href="#xd26e10858" name=
"xd26e10858src">6</a> and not a regular wall, and the hole was soon
cut. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;What fun!&rsquo; said the girl, as she jumped through.
&lsquo;Oh, how nice to be free! But,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t travel with you in these poor clothes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the stranger. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have a
travelling dress made for you, by the hunchback himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, take care!&rsquo; cried the girl, earnestly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rsquo; answered the stranger;
&lsquo;and above all don&rsquo;t look frightened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he sent his servant to call the hunchback, and when he came he
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want a travelling dress made directly for my wife here, so
please take her measure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hunchback started when he saw who it was he had to measure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, she&rsquo;s exactly like my Buona Grazia!&rsquo;
exclaimed he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very likely. I have always observed there was a sort of
likeness between the inhabitants of a town. She too is a Roman, though
I am a stranger. But make haste and take the measure, I didn&rsquo;t
call you here to make remarks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hunchback got frightened at the stranger&rsquo;s authoritative
tone, and took the measure without saying any more; and the stranger
then gave him something to go and have a breakfast at the
<i>caff&eacute;</i> to give the girl time to get back and set the
picture in its place again.</p>
<p>When he came up into the room all looked right, and nothing seemed
to have been moved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to work hard to-day,&rsquo; said the
hunchback, &lsquo;to get a travelling dress ready for the wife of a
gentleman staying in the inn, who is exactly like you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are they going to travel, then?&rsquo; asked la Buona
Grazia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, the gentleman said they should start as soon as the
dress is done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, do let me see them drive off!&rsquo; said la Buona
Grazia, coaxingly. &lsquo;I should so like to see a lady who looked
like me wearing a dress you had made.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, nonsense!&rsquo; said the hunchback; &lsquo;get on
with your work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And she did get on with her work, and stitched away, for she was
anxious enough to help him to get the dress done; but she went on
teazing him all the while to let her go to the window to see the
gentleman and the lady, &lsquo;who looked so like her,&rsquo; drive
off, that at last the hunchback consented for that only day to take the
whiting off the windows and let her look out.</p>
<p>The travelling dress was finished and taken home; and while the
hunchback was taking it up by the stairs, la Bella Grazia was getting
in by the hole behind the picture; but she had first made a great
doll,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10903src" href="#xd26e10903" name=
"xd26e10903src">7</a> and dressed it just like herself, and stuck it in
the window. The gobbo, who stood down below to see the gentry drive
off, looked up and saw her, as he thought, at the window, and made
signs for her not to stay there too long.</p>
<p>Presently the stranger and his lady came down; the hunchback was
standing before the carriage door, as I have said, and two stablemen
were standing by also.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You give me your good grace?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10911src" href="#xd26e10911" name="xd26e10911src">8</a> asked the
stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes!&rsquo; readily responded the hunchback, delighted
to find a rich gentleman so civil to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say it sincerely, with all your heart?&rsquo; again asked
the stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, yes! with all my heart,&rsquo; answered the
hunchback.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then give me your hand upon it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the hunchback, more and more delighted, put out his hand, the
two stablemen standing by looking on attentively all the time.</p>
<p>As soon as the carriage had driven away, the hunchback&rsquo;s first
care was to look up at the window to see if the girl had gone in; but
the doll was still there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go in! go in!&rsquo; he cried, waving his hand. But the
figure remained unmoved. Indignant, he took a stick and ran up to
punish the girl for her disobedience, and when <span class=

<h2 class="main"><i>THE VALUE OF SALT.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They say there was a king who had three daughters. He
was very anxious to know which of them loved him most; he tried them in
various ways, and it always seemed as if the youngest daughter came out
best by the test. Yet he was never satisfied, because <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e10940" title="Source: we has">he was</span>
prepossessed with the idea that the elder ones loved him most.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name=
"pb404">404</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day he thought he would settle the matter once for all, by
asking each separately how much she loved him. So he called the eldest
by herself, and asked her how much she loved him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As much as the bread we eat,&rsquo; ran her reply; and he
said within himself, &lsquo;She must, as I thought, love me the most of
all; for bread is the first necessary of our existence, without which
we cannot live. She means, therefore, that she loves me so much she
could not live without me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he called the second daughter by herself, and said to her,
&lsquo;How much do you love me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And she answered, &lsquo;As much as wine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is a good answer too,&rsquo; said the king to himself.
&lsquo;It is true she does not seem to love me quite so much as the
eldest; but still, scarcely can one live without wine,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e10954src" href="#xd26e10954" name=
"xd26e10954src">1</a> so that there is not much difference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he called the youngest by herself, and said to her, &lsquo;And
you, how much do you love me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And she answered, &lsquo;As much as salt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the king said, &lsquo;What a contemptible comparison! She only
loves me as much as the cheapest and commonest thing that comes to
table. This is as much as to say, she doesn&rsquo;t love me at all. I
always thought it was so. I will never see her again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he ordered that a wing of the palace should be shut up from the
rest, where she should be served with everything belonging to her
condition in life, but where she should live by herself apart, and
never come near him.</p>
<p>Here she lived, then, all alone. But though her father fancied she
did not care for him, she pined so much at being kept away from him,
that at last she was worn out,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10968src"
href="#xd26e10968" name="xd26e10968src">2</a> and could bear it no
longer.</p>
<p>The room that had been given her had no windows on to the street,
that she might not have the amusement of seeing what was going on in
the town, but they looked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href=
"#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>upon an inner court-yard. Here she
sometimes saw the cook come out and wash vegetables at the
fountain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cook! cook!&rsquo; she called one day, as she saw him pass
thus under the window.</p>
<p>The cook looked up with a good-natured face, which gave her
encouragement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, cook, I must be very lonely and
miserable up here all alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Signorina!&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;I often think I
should like to help you to get out; but I dare not think of it, the
king would be so angry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want you to do anything to disobey the
king,&rsquo; answered the princess; &lsquo;but would you really do me a
favour, which would make me very grateful indeed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O! yes, Signorina, anything which I can do without disobeying
the king,&rsquo; replied the faithful servant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then this is it,&rsquo; said the princess. &lsquo;Will you
just oblige me so far as to cook papa&rsquo;s dinner to-day without any
salt in anything? Not the least grain in anything at all. Let it be as
good a dinner as you like, but no salt in anything. Will you do
that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see!&rsquo; replied the cook, with a knowing nod.
&lsquo;Yes, depend on me, I will do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That day at dinner the king had no salt in the soup, no salt in the
boiled meat, no salt in the roast, no salt in the fried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the meaning of this?&rsquo; said the king, as he
pushed dish after dish away from him. &lsquo;There is not a single
thing I can eat to-day. I don&rsquo;t know what they have done to
everything, but there is not a single thing that has got the least
taste. Let the cook be called.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the cook came before him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you done to the victuals to-day?&rsquo; said the
king, sternly. &lsquo;You have sent up a lot of dishes, and no one
alive can tell one from another. They are all of them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406</a>]</span>exactly alike, and there is not one of them can
be eaten. Speak!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The cook answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hearing your Majesty say that salt was the commonest thing
that comes to table, and altogether so worthless and contemptible, I
considered in my mind whether it was a thing that at all deserved to be
served up to the table of the king; and judging that it was not worthy,
I abolished it from the king&rsquo;s kitchen, and dressed all the meats
without it. Barring this, the dishes are the same that are sent every
day to the table of the king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the king understood the value of salt, and he comprehended how
great was the love of his youngest child for him; so he sent and had
her apartment opened, and called her to him, never to go away any
more.</p>

<h2 class="main"><i>THE PRINCESS AND THE GENTLEMAN.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a princess whose mother had died of vexation
because she was in love with a simple gentleman of the chamber, and
would not hear of marrying anyone else, nor would she look at any
prince who came to sue for her hand.</p>
<p>The king, not only vexed at her perversity, but still more at the
loss of his wife, determined to devise a punishment to cure them both.
He had two suites of apartments walled up, therefore; in one he had the
princess imprisoned, and in the other the gentleman of the chamber with
whom she was in love. The latter, he commanded, should see no one,
thinking thereby to weary him out; the former he allowed only to see
such persons as he should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href=
"#pb407" name="pb407">407</a>]</span>appoint, these persons being the
princes one or other of whom he wished her to marry; for he thought
that in her weariness at being so shut up, she would welcome the hand
of anyone who would be her deliverer. It was not so, however. When the
cook came in to the princess with her dinner, she begged him to give
her a chicken that had been killed several days, and kept till it had a
bad smell.</p>
<p>When her father now sent any prince to visit her she said, &lsquo;It
is no use my father sending you here, the reason why I cannot marry
anyone is that I have a great defect; my breath smells so bad that it
is not pleasant for anyone to live with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the bad smell from the chicken was readily to be perceived in the
room, they all believed her words and went away. There was one, indeed,
who was so much pleased with her seeming candour that he thought he
would excuse her defect, but on a second visit the smell of the dead
chicken drove him away too.</p>
<p>The cooks in the kitchen talked together after the manner of cooks,
and thus the cook who waited on the princess told what had happened to
the cook who waited on the other prisoner, and thus it came round to
his ears also, what the princess had done for love of him. Her
stratagem then suggested another to him. Accordingly he sent to crave
urgently an audience of the king.</p>
<p>When the king came in to him he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sire, closely as I have been confined and guarded, yet
something of what goes on in the outer world has reached my ears, and
the fact which has the greatest interest for me has naturally been told
to me. I now learn that the reason why your daughter has refused the
suit of all the princes is not as we thought, her love for me, but a
certain personal defect, which in politeness I will not name more
particularly. But that being so, my desire to marry her is, of course,
cured like that of others; so if your majesty will give me my liberty I
will go away <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=
"pb408">408</a>]</span>to a far country, and your majesty would never
hear of me any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The king was delighted to get rid of him, for he believed that if he
were at a distance the great obstacle to his daughter&rsquo;s happiness
would be removed. As he knew nothing about the chicken, he thought that
all the suitors had believed the princess&rsquo;s representations upon
her simple word; and as he very well knew she had no defect, he thought
the time would come when some prince should please her, whom she also
should please. Therefore, he very willingly gave the gentleman his
liberty, and bid him godspeed on his journey.</p>
<p>The gentleman, however, before setting out, went to his friend the
cook, and, giving him three hundred scudi, begged him to house him for
a few nights, while he dug out an underground passage between the
garden and the apartment where the princess was imprisoned.</p>
<p>In the garden was a handsome terrace, all set out with life-sized
statues; under one of these the gentleman worked his way, till he had
reached the princess&rsquo;s chamber.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You here!&rsquo; exclaimed the princess in great
astonishment, as soon as he had made his way through.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I have come to fetch you,&rsquo; he replied.</p>
<p>She did not wait for a second injunction to escape from prison, but
gathering all the money and jewels she had at command, she followed him
through the underground way he had made.</p>
<p>As soon as they had reached the free air, the gentleman replaced the
statue, and no one could guess by which way they had passed. Then they
went to a church to be married, and, after that, to a city a long way
off, as the gentleman had promised the king he would.</p>
<p>For a long time they lived very happily on the money and jewels each
had brought from home; but, by-and-by, these came to an end, and
neither durst write for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href=
"#pb409" name="pb409">409</a>]</span>more, for fear of betraying where
they were. So at last, having no means of living, they engaged
themselves to a rich lady who had a large mansion;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e11049src" href="#xd26e11049" name="xd26e11049src">1</a> the
one as butler,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11052src" href="#xd26e11052"
name="xd26e11052src">2</a> and the other as nurse.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e11055src" href="#xd26e11055" name="xd26e11055src">3</a> Here
they were well content to live at peace; and the lady was well content
to have two such faithful and intelligent dependents, and they might
have lived here till the end of their lives, but for a
coincidence<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11058src" href="#xd26e11058"
name="xd26e11058src">4</a> which strangely disconcerted them, as you
shall hear, as well as what came of it.</p>
<p>One day there came to visit the lady, their mistress, a nobleman
belonging to the king&rsquo;s court. At dinner time the princess had to
come to table along with the little daughter of the house, of whom she
had the charge. Great was her terror when she recognised in the guest
of the day one so familiar to herself and so near the sovereign. In
conformity with the lowliness of the station she had assumed, she could
escape actually talking to him, and she did her best to withdraw
herself from his notice. She half hoped she had succeeded, when
suddenly the butler had to come into the room to communicate an
important despatch which had just arrived, to the mistress of the
house. The princess could not restrain an anxious glance at the
stranger, to see if he betrayed any sign of recognition; but he was
used to courts, and therefore to dissemble; nor could she satisfy
herself that he had discovered either of them. It was so likely that he
should, however, that she was filled with fear, and he was no sooner
gone than she held a long consultation with her husband as to what
course they should pursue.</p>
<p>In the end, the difficulty of finding other employment decided them
to remain, for the probability that they would be tracked seemed
remote. After all, they reasoned, was it likely that the nobleman
should think it worth while to observe two persons occupying such
humble posts with sufficient attention to see who they were or who they
were not? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name=
"pb410">410</a>]</span></p>
<p>The king meantime had been searching everywhere for his daughter,
not being able by any means to divine how she could have escaped. Then
one morning, all this time after, the nobleman comes down upon him with
the news:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have found the princess. She is living as nurse to the
Duchessa such a one, and her husband is the butler.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The king could not rest a moment after he had heard the news; his
travelling carriage was ordered round, and away he drove. It was just
dinner-time when he arrived at the Duchessa&rsquo;s palace. If the
princess had been terrified before, at being called to sit at table
with a nobleman of the court, judge how much greater was her alarm when
she saw her father himself seated at the board!</p>
<p>Great as had been his indignation, however, the joy of again meeting
his child after the long separation blotted out all his anger, and
after embracing her tenderly, he placed her by his side at the table.
It was only when he came to take leave, and realised that she really
belonged to another that his ire broke forth again. At this point the
Duchessa put in a word. She highly extolled the excellent qualities of
her butler, and declared he had been so skilful in the administration
of her affairs, that he deserved to have a kingdom committed to him. In
short, she softened the king&rsquo;s heart so completely that she
brought him to own that, as he had now grown very old and feeble, he
could not do better than recognise him for his son-in-law, and
associate him with himself in the government.</p>
<p>And so he did,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11077src" href=
"#xd26e11077" name="xd26e11077src">5</a> and they all lived happily.

perhaps. What a number I used to know, to be sure! But what can I do?
It is thirty years and more since anyone has asked me for them, and
it&rsquo;s hard to put one&rsquo;s ideas together after such a time.
You <span class="corr" id="xd26e11095" title=
"Source: musn&rsquo;t">mustn&rsquo;t</span> mind if I put the wrong
part of the story before, and have to go backwards and forwards a
little.</p>
<p>I know there was one that ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>There was a married couple who lived so happy and content and fond
of each other, that they never had a word of dispute about anything the
live-long day, but only thought of helping and pleasing each other.</p>
<p>The Devil saw this, and determined to set them by the ears; but how
was he to do it? Such love and peace reigned in their home, that he
couldn&rsquo;t find any way into the place. After prowling and prowling
about, and finding no means of entrance, what does he do? He went to an
old woman,&mdash;she must have been one of those who dabble with things
they have no business to touch,&mdash;and said to her:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must do this job for me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s no great matter,&rsquo; answered the old
hag.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11108src" href="#xd26e11108" name=
"xd26e11108src">3</a> &lsquo;Give me ten scudi for my niece and a new
pair of shoes for me, and I&rsquo;ll settle the matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here are the ten scudi,&rsquo; said the Devil; &lsquo;it will
be time enough to talk about the shoes when we see how you do the
business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The bad old woman set off accordingly with her niece and the ten
scudi, instructing her by the way what she was to do.</p>
<p>This husband and wife lived in a place where there was a house on
one side and a shop on the other, so that through a window in the house
where they lived they could give an eye to anything that went on in the
shop. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name=
"pb412">412</a>]</span></p>
<p>Choosing a moment when the man was alone in the shop, she sent the
girl in with the ten scudi; and the girl, who had been told what to do,
selected a dress, and a handkerchief, and a number of fine things, and
paid her ten scudi. Then she proceeded leisurely to put them on, and to
walk up and down the shop in them. Meantime the bad old woman went up
to the wife:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor woman!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Poor woman! Such a good
woman as you are, and to have such a hypocrite of a husband!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My husband a hypocrite!&rsquo; answered the wife. &lsquo;What
can you mean&mdash;he is the best man that ever was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! he makes you think so, poor simple soul. But the truth
is, he is very different from what you think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So they went on conversing, and the bad old woman all the time
watching what was going on in the shop till the right moment came. Just
as the girl was flaunting about and showing herself off, she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here, he has given all those things to that girl
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And though the wife did not believe a word, curiosity prompted her
to look, and there she saw the girl bowing herself out with as many
thanks and adieus as if the poor man had really given her the things
she had bought.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you will believe that!&rsquo; observed the bad old
woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I cannot help believing it,&rsquo; answered the wife,
&lsquo;but never otherwise should I have thought it; and I owe you a
great deal for opening my eyes;&rsquo; and she gave her a whole
cheese.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11137src" href="#xd26e11137" name=
"xd26e11137src">4</a> &lsquo;I know what I shall do,&rsquo; she
continued, as she sobbed over her lost peace of mind; &lsquo;I shall
show him I know his bad conduct by having no dinner ready for him when
he comes up by-and-by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said the bad old woman. &lsquo;Do
so, and show him you are not going to be trampled on for the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>sake of a drab of a girl like that;&rsquo; and
she tied her cheese up in a handkerchief, and went her way.</p>
<p>Down she went now to the husband, and plied him with suspicions of
his wife, similar to those she had suggested to her against him. The
husband was even less willing to listen to her than the wife had been,
and when at last he drove her away, she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think she&rsquo;s busy all the morning preparing your
dinner; but instead of that, she&rsquo;s talking to those you
wouldn&rsquo;t like her to talk with. And you see now if to-day she
hasn&rsquo;t been at this game so long that she has forgotten your
dinner altogether.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The husband turned a deaf ear, and continued attending to his shop;
but when he went into the house and found no dinner ready, it seemed as
if all that the bad old woman had said was come true.</p>
<p>He was too sad for words, so they didn&rsquo;t have much of a
quarrel, but there could not but be a coldness after such an
extraordinary event as a day without dinner.</p>
<p>The husband went back to his shop and mused. The wife sat alone in
her room crying; presently the old hag came back to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, did you tell him you had found him out?&rsquo; she
inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No! I hadn&rsquo;t courage to do that. And he was so patient
about there being no dinner, that I felt quite sorry to have suspected
him. Oh, you who have been so clever in pointing out my misery to me,
can you not tell me some means of reconciliation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, there is one; but I don&rsquo;t know if you can manage
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes; I would do <i>anything</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you must watch till he is quite sound asleep, and take a
sharp razor and cut off three hairs from the undergrowth of his beard,
quite close to the skin. If you do that it will all come right
again.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name=
"pb414">414</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems a very odd remedy,&rsquo; said the wife; &lsquo;but
if you say it will do, I suppose it will, and thank you kindly for the
advice;&rsquo; and she gave her another cheese.</p>
<p>Then the witch went back to the husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose I was mistaken, and you found your dinner ready
after all?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;you were right about there
being no dinner; but I am certain there was some cause for there being
none, other than what you say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What other cause should there be?&rsquo; exclaimed the old
woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;But some
other cause I am persuaded there must have been.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if you are so infatuated, I will give you another token
that I am right,&rsquo; replied the old woman. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t
deserve that I should save your life, but I am so goodnatured, I
can&rsquo;t help warning you. To-night, I have reason to know, she
intends to murder you. You just give some make-believe snoring, but
mind you don&rsquo;t sleep, whatever you do; and you see if she
doesn&rsquo;t take up one of your razors to stab you in the
throat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The good husband refused to believe a word, and drove her away.
Nevertheless, when night came he felt not a little anxious; and if he
had tried to sleep ever so much he could not, for he felt so excited.
Then curiosity to see if the woman&rsquo;s words would come true
overcame him, and he pretended to snore.</p>
<p>He had not been snoring thus long, when the wife took up the razor
and came all trembling to the bedside, and lifted up his beard.</p>
<p>A cold sweat crept over the poor husband as she approached&mdash;not
for fear of his life, which he could easily rescue, as he was
awake&mdash;but because the proof seemed there that the old hag had
spoken the truth. However, instead of taking it for granted it was so,
and refusing to hear any justification&mdash;perhaps killing her on the
spot, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name=
"pb415">415</a>]</span>she had hoped and expected,&mdash;he calmly
seized her arm, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me, what are you going to do with that razor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The wife sank on her knees by his side, crying:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot expect you to believe me, but this is really how it
was. An old woman came and told me you were making love to a young girl
in the shop, and showed me how she was bowing and scraping to you. I
was so vexed, that to show you my anger I got no dinner ready; but
afterwards, I felt as if I should like to ask you all about it, to make
sure there was no mistake: only after what I had done, I didn&rsquo;t
know how to begin speaking to you again. Then I asked the old woman if
she couldn&rsquo;t tell me some means of bringing things straight
again; and she said, if I could cut off three hairs from the
undergrowth of your beard, all would come right. But I can&rsquo;t
expect you to believe it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I do,&rsquo; replied the husband. &lsquo;The same old
wretch came to me, and wanted me in like manner to believe all manner
of evil things of you, but I refused to believe you could do anything
wrong. So I had more confidence in you than you had in me. But still we
were both very nearly making ourselves very foolish and very unhappy;
so we will take a lesson never to doubt each other again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And after that there never was a word between them any more.</p>
<p>When the Devil saw how the old woman had spoilt the affair, he took
the pair of shoes he was to have given her, and tied them on to a long
cane which he fastened on the top of a mountain, and there they dangled
before her eyes, but she could never get at them.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They say there was a countess who was very fond of her
husband, and her husband was very fond of her; and they vowed nothing
should ever make the one think ill of the other.</p>
<p>One day the brother of the countess, who had been long away at the
wars, and whom the count had never seen, came back to see her just
while the count was out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now we&rsquo;ll have some fun,&rsquo; said the countess.
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll watch till my husband is coming home, and then as he
comes into the room you just be kissing me; he will be so astonished to
see a stranger kissing me, he will not know what to make of it. Then in
five minutes we will tell him who you really are, and it will make a
good laugh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The brother thought it would be a good joke, and they did as she had
said.</p>
<p>It happened, however, that by accident<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e11225src" href="#xd26e11225" name="xd26e11225src">2</a> the count
did not that day as usual come into his wife&rsquo;s room, but passing
along the terrace in front of it, he saw, as she had arranged, one who
was a stranger to him kissing her.</p>
<p>Then he went into his room, and calling his confidential
servant<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11230src" href="#xd26e11230" name=
"xd26e11230src">3</a> he told him what had happened, and adding,
&lsquo;You will never see me any more,&rsquo; went his way.</p>
<p>The countess waited on and on for her husband to come in, full of
impatience to have her joke out. But when she found he did not come at
all, she went into his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href=
"#pb417" name="pb417">417</a>]</span>room to seek him there. There she
found the servant, who told her what the Count had said, and the
desperate resolution he had taken.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have I done!&rsquo; exclaimed the terrified Countess.
&lsquo;Is it possible that I am to be punished thus for a harmless
joke!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, without saying anything to anyone she wrapped her travelling
cloak about her, and set out to seek her husband.</p>
<p>The Count had walked on till he could walk no farther, and then he
had gone into an inn, where he hired a room for a week; but he went
wandering about the woods in misery and despair, and only came in at an
hour of night.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11243src" href="#xd26e11243"
name="xd26e11243src">4</a></p>
<p>The Countess also walked on till she could walk no farther, and thus
she came to the same inn; but as she had only a woman&rsquo;s strength
the same journey took her a much longer time, and it was the afternoon
of the next day when she arrived. She too asked for a room, but the
host assured her with many expressions of regret, that he had not a
single room vacant. The Countess pleaded her weariness; the man
reiterated his inability to serve her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me only a room to rest a little while in,&rsquo; she
begged; &lsquo;just a couple of hours, and then I will start again and
journey farther.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Really compassionating her in her fatigue, the man now said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will be satisfied with that much, I can give you a
room for a couple of hours; but no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was fain to be satisfied with that, as she could get no more,
and the host showed her into her husband&rsquo;s room, which he would
not want till &lsquo;an hour of night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By accident, however, the Count came in that night an hour earlier,
and very much surprised he was to find a lady in his room. The
Countess, equally surprised to see a stranger enter, pulled her veil
over her face, so that they did not recognise each other. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href="#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to disturb you, madam, but this room, I must
inform you, I have engaged,&rsquo; said the count; but sorrow had so
altered his voice that the countess did not know it again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you will spare me,&rsquo; replied the Countess.
&lsquo;They gave me this room to rest in for two hours, and I have come
so long a way that I really need the rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can hardly believe that a lady of gentle condition can have
come a very long way, all alone and on foot, for there is no carriage
in the yard; so I can only consider this a frivolous pretext,&rsquo;
replied the Count, for sorrow had embittered him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed it is too true though,&rsquo; continued the Countess.
&lsquo;I came all the way from such a place (and she named his own
town) without stopping for one moment&rsquo;s rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said the Count, his interest roused at the
mention of his own town; &lsquo;and pray what need had you to use such
haste to get away from that good town?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had no need to haste to leave the place,&rsquo; replied the
Countess, hurt at the implied suspicion that she was running away for
shame. &lsquo;I hasted to arrive at another place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that other place was &mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo; persisted the
Count, who felt that her intrusion on his privacy gave him a right to
cross-question her.</p>
<p>The Countess was puzzled how to reply. She had no idea what place
she was making for.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>That</i> I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; she said at last, with
no little embarrassment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will permit me to say that you seem to have no adequate
reason to allege for this unwarrantable occupation of my room; and what
little you tell me certainly in no way inclines me to take a favourable
view of the affair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Countess was once more stung by the manner in which he seemed to
view her journey, and feeling bound to clear herself, she replied:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;If you only knew what my journey is about, you would not
speak so!&rsquo; and she burst into a flood of tears.</p>
<p>Softened by her distress, the Count said in a kinder tone:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had you been pleased to confide that to me at first, maybe I
had not spoken so; but till you tell me what it is, what opinion can I
form?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is it,&rsquo; answered the Countess, still sobbing.
&lsquo;Yesterday I was the happiest woman on the face of the earth,
living in love and confidence with the best husband with whom woman was
ever blessed. So strong was my confidence that I hesitated not to
trifle with this great happiness. My brother came home from the wars, a
stranger to my husband. &ldquo;Let him see you kiss me,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;it will seem so strange that we will make him laugh heartily
afterwards.&rdquo; He saw him kiss me, but waited for no explanation.
He went away without a word, as indeed (fool that I was) I well
deserved, and I journey on till I overtake him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Count had risen to his feet, and had torn the veil from her
face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It can be no other but my own!&rsquo; he exclaimed, in a
voice from which sorrow being banished his own tones sounded forth, and
clasped her in his arms.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a very rich Countess who was a widow and
lived all alone, with no companion but only a cat, after her husband
died. The greatest care was taken of this cat, and every day a chicken
was boiled on purpose for him.</p>
<p>One day the Countessa went out to spend the day at a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name=
"pb420">420</a>]</span>friend&rsquo;s villa in the Campagna, and she
said to the waiting woman:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mind the cat has his chicken just the same as if I were at
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes! Signora Countessa, leave that to me,&rsquo; answered the
woman; but the Countess was no sooner gone out than she said to the
man-servant:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The cat has the chicken every day; suppose we have it
to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &lsquo;To be sure!&rsquo; and they ate the chicken
themselves, giving the cat only the inside; but they threw the bones
down in the usual corner, to make it appear as if he had eaten the
whole chicken.</p>
<p>The cat said nothing, but looked on with great eyes, full of
meaning.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11322src" href="#xd26e11322" name=
"xd26e11322src">2</a></p>
<p>When the Countess came back that evening the cat, instead of going
out to meet her as he always did, remained still in his place and said
nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the cat? Hasn&rsquo;t he had his
chicken?&rsquo; asked the Countess, immediately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes! Signora Countessa,&rsquo; answered the cameriera.
&lsquo;See, there are the bones on the floor, where he always leaves
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Countessa could not deny the testimony of her eyes, so she said
nothing more but went up to bed.</p>
<p>The cat followed her as he always did, for he slept on her bed; but
he followed at a distance, without purring or rubbing himself against
her. The Countess saw something was wrong, but she didn&rsquo;t know
what to make of it, and went to bed as usual.</p>
<p>That night the cat throttled<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11338src"
href="#xd26e11338" name="xd26e11338src">3</a> the Countess, and killed
her.</p>
<p>The cat is very intelligent in his own interest, but he is a
traitor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would have been more intelligent,&rsquo; I observed,
&lsquo;if he had throttled the waiting woman in this instance.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name=
"pb421">421</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not at all; the cat&rsquo;s reasoning was this:&mdash;If thou hadst
not gone out and left me to the mercy of menials, this had not
happened; therefore it was thou who hadst to die.</p>
<p>This is quite true, for cats are always traitors. Dogs are faithful,
cats are traitors.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11353src" href=

<p class="editorial">[Perhaps this tale would have been hardly worth
printing, but that the selfsame story was told me as a positive fact by
an Irishman, who could not have come across the Italian story. In the

<p class="first">&lsquo;Ah! as to cats and mice, listen and
<i>I</i>&rsquo;ll tell you something worth hearing!</p>
<p>&lsquo;In America, once upon a time, there were no cats. Mice there
were in plenty; mice everywhere; not peeping out of holes now and then,
but infesting everything, swarming over every room; and when a family
sat down to meals, the mice rushed upon the table and disputed the
victuals with them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then one thought of a plan; he freighted three ships; full,
full of cats, and off to America with them. There he sold them for
their weight in gold and more, and <i>whiff!</i> the mice were swept
away, and he made a great fortune. A great fortune, all out of
cats!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">I have done injustice to the part assigned to the
horse in French legendary tales by omitting mention of it in this
place. Charles Louandre (&lsquo;<span lang=
"fr">Chefs-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre des conteurs
Fran&ccedil;ais</span>,&rsquo; Paris, 1873, note to pp. 43&ndash;4)
calls special attention to it and gives us the name of many horses
famous in the old French minstrelsy. There was &lsquo;Valentin,&rsquo;
the horse of Roland; &lsquo;Tencedor, of Charlemagne;&rsquo;
&lsquo;Barbamouche, swifter than the swallow;&rsquo; and many others.
But there is no name to the charger in the graceful &lsquo;Lai de
Gra&eacute;lent,&rsquo; by Marie de France, whose fidelity is the
occasion of his Note. I ought not to have forgotten either, the honours
paid him in the Spanish Romances, of which the brave &lsquo;Black
Charger of Hernando&rsquo; (&lsquo;Patra&ntilde;as&rsquo;) may serve as
the type.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">My attention has been called, while these sheets have
been passing through the press, to a collection which enables me to
subjoin some notes of analogies between the Folktales of France and
those in the text. It is entitled &lsquo;Recueil des Contes des
F&eacute;es,&rsquo; Geneva, 1718; published without author&rsquo;s
name, and the stories are much less artificially treated than in the
better known collections of the Comtesse d&rsquo;Aulnoy, de Caylus,
Perrault, Madame de Villeneuve, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Monteil (&lsquo;<span lang="fr">Trait&eacute; de
Mat&eacute;riaux-Manuscrits</span>,&rsquo; Paris, 1835) mentions a MS.
in his possession, of the year 1618, entitled &lsquo;Contes des
F&eacute;es,&rsquo; from which Perrault, the least artificial of the
French collectors, seems to have drawn his tales. Mayer
(&lsquo;<span lang="fr">Discours <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426"
href="#pb426" name="pb426">426</a>]</span>sur l&rsquo;Origine des
Contes des F&eacute;es</span>,&rsquo; Geneva and Paris, 1786) ascribes
to him the revival of the knowledge of the existence of popular fairy
tales and medi&aelig;val romances, and many of our own Nursery Rimes
(notably &lsquo;Puss in Boots&rsquo;) are simply translated from his
versions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Prince Rainbow&rsquo; (&lsquo;<span lang="fr">Le Prince
Arc-en-Ciel</span>&rsquo;), the fifth story in the
&lsquo;Recueil,&rsquo; contains similar incidents with those in
&lsquo;Filagranata,&rsquo; in combination with the introduction of the
opening of a nut in place of one of the oranges in my next story. (I
have another Roman story in MS. which hinges on the opening of three
nuts in the place of three oranges.) In the French story the ire of the
bad fairy is excited against the princess who holds the place of
Filagranata, by her receiving the name of
&lsquo;Fairer-than-Fairies&rsquo; (&lsquo;<span lang=
"fr">Plus-belle-que-F&eacute;e</span>&rsquo;). The bad fairy
Lagr&eacute;e, who is so old that she has only one tooth and one eye,
carries her off to an underground palace, where her task is to tend a
fire, instead of feeding pigeons. Here she is courted by a prince
transformed into a rainbow, whom she finds of course always seated in
the sunshine on a fountain. While talking to him, she lets her fire
out. Lagr&eacute;e sends her to get fresh fire from the giant Locrinos,
devourer of maidens; the giant&rsquo;s wife takes compassion on her,
and gives her the fire, and with it a stone to use in time of distress.
Lagr&eacute;e, in fury at her success, sends away Prince Rainbow.
Fairer-than-Fairies escapes, and goes in search of him, taking with her
the stone, a branch of myrtle, and her cat and dog; when she is weary
with wandering, the stone provides her a cave to sleep in, the dog
keeping guard. Lagr&eacute;e pursues her; the dog attacks her, and
throws her down, so that she breaks her only tooth, and the princess
escapes for another stage. Lagr&eacute;e overtakes her again as she is
sleeping in a bower the branch of myrtle has raised for her. The cat
makes the defence this time, scratching out her only eye, finally
disabling her. After this, Fairer-than-Fairies is entertained in a
white and green palace by a white and green lady, who gives her a nut,
to be used only in direst need. After another year&rsquo;s wanderings,
another white and green lady gives her a pomegranate; at the end of
another year, another gives her a crystal vial. Afterwards she comes to
a silver palace, suspended by silver chains from four trees. She then
breaks the nut; a Swiss appears and admits her, and she finds
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name=
"pb427">427</a>]</span>Prince Rainbow in an enchanted sleep, answering
to the kiss of forgetfulness in &lsquo;Filagranata.&rsquo;
Fairer-than-Fairies breaks open the pomegranate, all the pips become
violins, whose melody makes the prince open his eyes. She breaks open
the crystal flask, and a Seiren appears, who sings the tale of all the
princess has endured. The prince wakes&mdash;the spell is ended. The
silver palace turns into a real and inhabited one. They embrace, and
are married.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Incarnat, Blanc et Noir,&rsquo; in the same
&lsquo;Recueil,&rsquo; is very similar to the &lsquo;Three
Love-Oranges.&rsquo; A prince walking out in the snow sees a crow. He
tries his skill at bringing him down, and the black bird falls bleeding
on the white snow. The sight makes him desire a maiden who combines
these three tints. Suddenly a voice tells him to go to the
&lsquo;Kingdom of Marvels,&rsquo; and that there he will find a tree
with splendid apples (they are not expressly said to be golden). He is
to take three, and not to open them till he reaches home. Curiosity
overcomes him by the way; he opens one, and a beautiful maiden appears;
before he can embrace her she disappears. Afterwards, his homeward
travels lead him on the sea; the desire to open one of the apples again
overcomes him, but though he orders the vessel to be closely covered
down all over, the second maiden disappears like the first. He only
opens the third on reaching home, and then there comes to him a maiden
exactly such as he desired, whom he marries. Afterwards he goes to the
wars; and the mother-in-law, who hated her all along, kills her, and
throws her body in the castle moat, and substitutes another woman, a
creature of her own. The prince expresses his surprise, but she assures
him the different appearance is only the effect of a spell. The prince,
however, pines after his own maiden. One day he sees swimming in the
castle moat a fish with red, white, and black scales, which he spends
all his time in gazing at. The false wife pretends she has an
irrepressible desire to eat that particular fish; she is in a delicate
state of health, and he cannot refuse her. After that a tree springs up
suddenly, which once more presents the three colours. The false wife
(inspired by the mother-in-law) demands that it shall be cut down and
burnt. He cannot refuse her. Finally, a palace, built of rubies,
pearls, and jet, suddenly appears by the side of his own. By unheard-of
exertion he gets into it, and there <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb428" href="#pb428" name="pb428">428</a>]</span>finds in a cabinet
his own maiden, whom he recalls to his side.</p>
<p>Another (&lsquo;<span lang="fr">Le Buisson d&rsquo;&Eacute;pines
fleuries</span>&rsquo;) contains noticeable analogies with both the
group of &lsquo;The Pot of Marjoram,<span class="corr" id="xd26e11452"
title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span> and that of &lsquo;Maria
Wood.&rsquo; The mother of a fairy princess is led to fill the
stepmother&rsquo;s part towards her, by her having so lavishly
distributed the ointment of perpetual youth, which had been entrusted
to her keeping, that none is left for the queen&rsquo;s own use when
she desires to have recourse to it to regain the lost affections of her
husband, an earthly king. The governess comes to the aid of the
princess, and they fly away together with tents and all requisites of
the journey stowed away in pearls for travelling boxes (some analogy,
perhaps, with the &lsquo;Candeliera&rsquo;). Their adventures bring
them across Prince Zelindor, who marries the princess. The vengeance of
the fairy mother pursues them in various shapes, till at last she turns
Zelindor into a Sweet Briar. The princess is attracted towards the
plant, and tends it with the greatest care, without knowing it is her
husband. The enraged fairy queen orders her to pluck a branch, and she
is obliged to obey. The plant flows with blood, and Zelindor declares
she is the cause of his death; at this juncture the husband of the
fairy queen, fetched by the benevolent governess, appears. His return
reconciles the queen to her daughter; and with an elixir she heals
Zelindor&rsquo;s wounds, and restores him to his bride.</p>
<p>Perrault&rsquo;s rimed fable of &lsquo;Peau d&rsquo;&Acirc;ne&rsquo;
is much nearer &lsquo;Maria Wood.&rsquo; The dying queen binds the king
to marry no one who does not surpass her in beauty and understanding.
Only their daughter comes up to the mark. Her fairy godmother tells her
to ask for the brilliant dresses, and finally for the skin of a
gold-coin-producing donkey. The king sacrifices even this. The fairy
tells her to put on this skin while she stows her sunbeam dresses,
jewels, &amp;c., in a press which she promises shall follow underground
wherever she carries her wand. She is made hen-wife in a king&rsquo;s
farmyard, and puts on her brilliant dresses on holidays in her private
room. The prince sees her through the keyhole, and falls ill because
his parents object to the union. &lsquo;Peau d&rsquo;&Acirc;ne&rsquo;
makes him a cake into which she drops one of her rings. The prince is
charmed with the idea of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href=
"#pb429" name="pb429">429</a>]</span>hand it suggests to him; his
malady increases, and this softens his parents. He says he will marry
no one but her whom the ring fits, and thus of course &lsquo;Peau
d&rsquo;&Acirc;ne&rsquo; marries him.</p>
<p>The counterpart, in Perrault, to the group to which &lsquo;Il
R&egrave; Moro&rsquo; belongs is a very clever, but somewhat
artificially told story, called &lsquo;Kadour.&rsquo; Kadour, an
exquisitely beautiful princess of Cashmere, is utterly deficient, not
in riches, like the chicory-seller&rsquo;s daughter, but in mind. She
comes one day to a hole in the ground, and a monstrous figure comes out
of it, and offers her the gift of mind, on condition of marrying him in
a year. Without knowing what mind is, she has perceived that all her
exceeding beauty has been powerless to attract any of the attention she
has seen lavished on others, and she gives a sort of stupid consent.
The monster tells her that the gift of mind is to be obtained by simply
repeating the words, &lsquo;O Love, who canst inspire all things; if it
needs but to love to lose my insipidity, behold I am ready!&rsquo;</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;O toi qui peux tout animer,</p>
<p class="line">Amour, si pour n&rsquo;&ecirc;tre plus b&ecirc;te</p>
<p class="line">Il ne faut que savoir aimer,</p>
<p class="line xd26e1629">Je suis pr&ecirc;te.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In proportion as she repeats these words she is filled
with intelligence; but no sooner is she so gifted than everyone
appreciates and surrounds her, and she soon falls in love with Arada,
the handsomest of her adorers. When the monster returns at the end of
the year, and takes her down to his palace through the hole in the
earth, she is in great perplexity what decision to make. She perceives
that either way she must lose Arada, and says that she cannot give any
answer; the monster says he will decide for her, and send her back to
her first estate. Her newly-acquired powers, however, give her such
loathing of this condition, that she finally prefers retaining her mind
even on the terrible condition already propounded. The monster declares
himself King of the Gnomes, master of boundless riches, and every kind
of luxury and pleasure is lavished on her, as on the chicory-seller, to
reconcile her with her situation; but in this case all in vain. She
contrives to let Arada know her unhappy position, that she may have the
benefit of his sympathy. The gnome-king punishes her by transforming
his handsome person <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430"
name="pb430">430</a>]</span>into a duplicate of his own, so that Kadour
never knows to which of them she is speaking.</p>
<p>This story is better known under the title of &lsquo;Riquet &agrave;
la Houpe,&rsquo; under which name it has been dramatised; in this,
however, the senseless but beautiful princess has the compensatory
faculty of rendering handsome her mind-giving but hideous lover, and
therefore the happy <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> is easily worked out. It
is also the foundation of &lsquo;Beauty and the Beast;&rsquo; and
probably springs from the same idea as that embodied in the Ardshi
Bordshi story I have given as &lsquo;Who invented Woman,&rsquo; in
&lsquo;Sagas from the Far East.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A sort of counterpart to the story of &lsquo;<span lang="it">Il
R&egrave; Moro</span>&rsquo; is given under the title of
&lsquo;<span lang="fr">Le Prince Sincer</span>,&rsquo; in
Gueulette&rsquo;s &lsquo;<span lang="fr">Fabliaux, ou Soir&eacute;es
Bretonnes</span>,&rsquo; but this series seems to be but a <i lang=
"fr">r&eacute;chauff&eacute;</i> of Oriental tales, and not a
collection of local traditions, as the name leads one to expect,
notwithstanding that he introduces Druids into them. The story I have
named forms a link also in some of its details with that in the text
called &lsquo;<span lang="it">I Satiri</span>.&rsquo; Another of the
same series, called &lsquo;<span lang="fr">Le Prince
Engageant</span>,&rsquo; has some analogy with the &lsquo;<span lang=
"it">Tre Merangoli di Amore</span>&rsquo; (The Three Love-Oranges), in
a prince finding his bride by giving her a pomegranate while she is
transformed as a dragon.</p>
<p>In a note to his translation of the ballad of &lsquo;<span lang=
"fr">P&eacute;r&eacute;dur ou le Bassin Magique</span>,&rsquo; Th. de
la Villemarqu&eacute;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11509src" href=
"#xd26e11509" name="xd26e11509src">1</a> gives a Breton version of the
&lsquo;Three Golden Apples&rsquo; story. P&eacute;r&eacute;dur is
induced to abandon the state of retirement in which his mother has kept
him, after the death of his father and his five brothers, by seeing
Owen ride by, &lsquo;seeking the knight who divided the apples at the
Court of Arthur.&rsquo; Upon this the annotator remarks that the
episode here alluded to has not been discovered; but, by way of
compensation, he supplies the following, which was told him by a
peasant of the diocese of Quimper, who could not read, and had received
it by tradition from his forefathers.</p>
<p>King Arthur was holding a feast at Lannion, in Brittany; five other
kings assisted at it, with their wives and their suite. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name="pb431">431</a>]</span>Just
as dinner is over Merlin appears, and hands three golden apples to the
king, and says they are to be adjudged to the three most beautiful
women. There is a great commotion, and blood is about to flow in the
dispute, when an unknown knight advances into the hall, mounted on a
black charger with so luxuriant a mane that it envelops both him and
his rider. The cause of dispute is referred to him for arbitration. He
takes up the three apples, and compares their colour to the hair of the
five queens, and their perfume to the ladies&rsquo; breath; but settles
the competition, like &lsquo;the Gold-Spitting Prince,&rsquo; in
&lsquo;Sagas from the Far East,&rsquo; by disappearing with the
prize.</p>
<p>He further quotes, from &lsquo;Myvyrian,&rsquo; i. 151, 152, 155,
that Merlin was so fond of apples that he devoted a poem to their
celebration, and declared he had an orchard with 147 apple-trees of the
greatest beauty; their shade was as valued as their fruit, and was
confided to the care, not of a dragon, but of a fair maiden, with
floating hair and teeth like drops of dew.</p>

which has curious analogies both with this tale of the Pilgrims, with
another Roman story I have in MS., and with that of &lsquo;The Irish
Princess&rsquo; in &lsquo;Patra&ntilde;as.&rsquo; Ad&egrave;le de
Ponthieu was married to Thi&eacute;bault de Domart. They go a
pilgrimage to S. James of Compostella to pray that they may have heirs.
Robbers overcome them by the way, bind Thi&eacute;bault to a tree, and
ill-treat Ad&egrave;le. As soon as she escapes from them
Thi&eacute;bault calls to her to cut his bonds with his sword; she,
judging it better that he should die than live to blush for her,
attempts to take his life with the same blow which severs the cord; he
foresees her intention and circumvents it. He does not divine her
motive, but yet makes no allusion to the matter till they return from
their pilgrimage, then he puts it as an A and B case to her father; the
father decides such a woman should die. She is put into a barrel and
cast into the sea; the barrel is picked up by merchants who sell her to
the Sultan, and she becomes the mother of the mother of Saladin.
Meantime her father and husband cannot rest for love of her, they go to
search the world over for her. A shipwreck makes them the property of
the Sultan who makes a present of them to Ad&egrave;le. She,
recognising them, pretends to be a Saracen soothsayer, and by revealing
her acquaintance with their previous history, like the injured Queen in
&lsquo;The Pilgrims,&rsquo; brings them to an expression of penitence
and of lasting love for her. She then escapes with them and lives
happily with her husband, the Pope prescribing to her a certain
penitential rule of life to purge her involuntary infidelity.
